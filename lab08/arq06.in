administratium n a chemical element which makes plutonium look tame 

from the news release 

new chemical element discovered 

the heaviest element known to science was recently discovered by 
investigators at a major us research university the element 
tentatively named administratium has no protons or electrons and 
thus has an atomic number of however it does have one neutron 
assistant neutrons vice neutrons and assistant vice 
neutrons which gives it an atomic mass of these particles 
are held together by a force that involves the continuous exchange 
of mesonlike particles called morons 

since it has no electrons administratium is inert however it can 
be detected chemically as it impedes every reaction it comes in 
contact with according to the discoverers a minute amount of 
administratium causes one reaction to take over four days to 
complete when it would have normally occurred in less than a 
second 

administratium has a normal halflife of approximately three years 
at which time it does not decay but instead undergoes a 
reorganization in which assistant neutrons vice neutrons and 
assistant vice neutrons exchange places some studies have shown 
that the atomic mass actually increases after each reorganization 

research at other laboratories indicates that administratium occurs 
naturally in the atmosphere it tends to concentrate at certain 
points such as government agencies large corporations and 
universities it can usually be found in the newest best 
appointed and best maintained buildings 

scientists point out that administratium is known to be toxic at 
any level of concentration and can easily destroy any productive 
reaction where it is allowed to accumulate attempts are being made 
to determine how administratium can be controlled to prevent 
irreversible damage but results to date are not promising

anathema adj and n consecrated and holy the term originally denoted 
a special offering hanging in a temple and has come to mean a degree 
of holiness which borders on superlative 

the supreme being is the most holy the angels in his presence shield 
their faces so that they will not see him and be destroyed secondary 
to this is a degree of holiness such that anything which touches it 
must be destroyed the ark of the covenant was holy it was to be 
carried only with poles and when uzzah touched it in order to steady 
it he was destroyed the book of joshua records an entire city of 
such sanctity that it was anathema achan stole goods from it and 
fierce anger burned against the whole nation of israel until he was 
destroyed 

it is possible for this sanctity to be conferred by benediction one 
form used contains the words let him be anathema that is to say 
a person as well as an object can be so sacred and holy as to be 
anathema 

commonly this benediction is bestowed upon other believers the 
present unity of the church is so complete that it is frequently 
bestowed upon other christians whose beliefs legitimately differ 
slightly and almost never bestowed on heretics

apocryphal adj hidden 

originally the term denoted the writings of certain mystery religions 
which were hidden from all who were not part of the elite of 
initiates such as the orthodox book of common prayer over time the 
word has shifted in meaning it is the nature of christianity to 
proclaim its truths not to hide them thus there was no need for 
apocryphal books in the first sense the term was applied to books 
which were hidden for another entirely different reason namely 
books which were excluded due to heretical content such as james or 
the book of ecclesiastes there may be a second connection between the 
two usages of the word but it is wisely left unmentioned

arranged marriage n a marriage not chosen by the parties involved 
arranged marriages exhibit far lower divorce rates than those 
voluntarily chosen 

that they be more successful is not really as strange as it may seem 
at first 

in america you marry the girl you love in india you love the 
girl you marry 

a man speaking in a video on indian philosophy 

there is a fundamental difference in how arranged and voluntarily 
chosen marriages tend to be approached voluntary marriages tend to be 
approached as if i can just find the right person we can live 
happily ever after arranged marriages are not approached with any 
delusions of being an effortless bliss or some sort of box that one 
can take things out of without putting anything into but with poorer 
conditions with a bride and groom that not only have not chosen 
each other but have not necessarily met before the day of the wedding 
people decide to make it work therefore it is not the lands of 
arranged marriages but america which is the land of divorce 

the difference between expecting something to be fruitful without any 
effort and without any sacrifice and expecting something to be 
difficult but choosing via effort and sacrifice to make it work is a 
difference between disappointment and a rewarding joy and applies to 
much more of life than only marriage

beautiful adj distorted and unnatural 

one of the enduring aspects of human culture is a tradition which 
universally establishes a single standard of beauty one for the male 
body and especially one for the female 

there is some feature which may be attractive and is exaggerated out 
of all proportion or alternately some feature which is 
unattractive and is exaggerated out of all proportion 

because a long and slender neck looks beautiful a nice contrast to 
the thick bulges of a mans shape theres a tribe in africa which 
uses copper braces to stretch out womens necks to be a foot long 

china noting that men have big feet and a feminine shape involves 
small feet has the practice of footbinding using the one kind of 
footwear tighter than climbing boots in order to painfully keep feet 
from growing any larger than those of a little girl 

recent anthropological findings report an obscure culture which has 
successfully made the transition from ridiculous to bombastic it has 
decided that the roundness of feminine beauty should be replaced with 
the shape of a prepubescent boy and reacted to modern technology by 
using the womans body as a repository for gelatinous capsules

congress n a body of men whose sole purpose in existence is to pile 
law upon law upon law 

the fundamental belief embodied in this philosophy is that a nation at 
peace with itself is ordered and held together not by love and true 
religion nor by honor and morality nor even by a minimal attempt to 
act according to confuciouss simple words do not do unto others 
what you would not have them do unto you but rather by the brute 
force of edicts issued by the sovereign 

therefore when the nation was first formed and not only did held 
together but actually built itself up by leaps and bounds the 
legislators believed it their duty to create laws when the nations 
growth began to slow and problems to increase the legislators 
believed it their duty to attempt to improve the situation by creating 
laws and now as the nation is crumbling when it is common for a 
mere child to carry a caliber handgun because he does not feel 
safe at school it is by the force of tax laws hundreds of pages long 
and penal codes which the lawmakers themselves could not hope to read 
that the legislature seeks to stem the ever advancing tide of chaos

cybertechnology which is not remedial a replacement for a defective

essentially the property of science fiction writers who allow all 
manner of incredible technology to enter the body 

the prime exception if it is to be counted as such is chemical 
there exist drugs which exert special impact on the body most are 
used in medical fashion an antibiotic or some other such function 
but there are a few which act to improve the function of a person

environmentalist n one devoted to a particular political agenda 
regardless of its impact on the environment 

a recent project at argonne national laboratory was working on a new 
generation of nuclear reactor which would be in many ways a dream come 
true its design would be such that meltdown would be physically 
impossible it could run on nuclear waste from other plants not only 
generating power but reducing them to material which would become 
harmless in a matter of roughly a century rather than millions of 
years it could run on nuclear warheads thus not only providing a 
safe and permanent manner to dispose of some of the most appalling and 
destructive devices ever created but so doing in a manner which would 
provide useful energy to hospitals and families a beautiful picture 
of what it means to beat swords into ploughshares 

however it is still nuclear and in the eyes of environmentalism 
all nuclear power is evil and must be stopped at any cost this 
project was most definitely stopped at any cost it was terminated 
at great monetary cost it was nearing completion and now that it 
was ready to be tested on different materials those materials must be 
disposed of at a cost of ninetyfour million dollars more than it 
would have cost to complete it was terminated at great environmental 
cost those materials are dangerous nuclear wastes and though they 
were going to be made harmless they must now be disposed of in 
established manners that is to say function as the nuclear waste 
that environmentalists so adamantly oppose however they stopped 
something bearing the dirty n word so environmentalists are now 
happy 

it is at least fortunate that environmentalists do not yet have the 
means to extinguish the sun

evil n that which is twisted depraved and wicked 

once upon a time a king wished that his people know what evil was so 
that his people could learn to recognize and flee from it he issued a 
summons that in a year all of his artists should come to him with 
one picture to show what was evil the best picture would be 
displayed to the people 

in a year they all appeared at the kings palace there were very few 
artists in the kingdom but those who were there were very skillful 
and worked as they had never worked before each brought a picture 
beneath a shroud 

the king turned to the first artist who had come jesse unveil your 
picture and tell us its interpretation 

jesse lifted the cloth against a background of blackened skulls was a 
dark green serpent the color of venom and poison with eyes that 
glowed red your majesty it was the serpent whose treacherous venom 
deceived man to eat of the forbidden fruit the eye is the lamp of the 
body and the serpents eye burns with the fires of hell you see that 
beyond the serpent are skulls evil ensnares unto death and outer 
darkness 

the court murmured its approval the picture was striking and spoke 
its lesson well the king also approved well done jesse if 
another picture is chosen it will not be because you have done 
poorly now gallio please show us your work 

gallio unveiled his painting in it was a man his face red and veins 
bulging from hate in his hand he held a curved dagger he was slowly 
advancing towards a woman cowering in fear your majesty man is 
created in the image of god and human life is sacred thus the way we 
are to love god is often by loving our neighbor there are few 
blasphemies more unholy than murder you have asked me for a picture 
to show what evil is that your subjects may flee from it this is 
evil to flee from 

the court again murmured its approval and the king began to shift 
slightly it was not as some supposed because of the repellent 
nature of the pictures but because he had secretly hoped that there 
would be only one good picture now it was evident that the decision 
would not be so simple gallio you have also done well and simon 
your picture 

simon unveiled his picture and people later swore that they could 
smell a stench there in the picture was the most hideous and 
misshapen beast they had ever seen its proportions were distorted 
and its colors were ghastly the left eye was green and taller than 
it was wide the right eye was even larger than the left red 
bloodshot and flowing with blood where there should have been a 
pupil a claw grotesquely protruded it was covered with claws teeth 
fur scales blood slime tentacles and bits of rotted flesh 
several members of the court excused themselves however it may be 
disguised evil is that which is sick distorted and ugly 

there was a long silence finally the king spoke again i see that 
there are three powerful pictures of evil any one of which is easily 
a masterpiece and well fit to show to the people barak i know that 
you have been given artistic genius and that perhaps your picture 
will help me with this difficult decision unveil your picture 

barak unveiled his picture and an awestruck hush fell over the court 
there unveiled was the most beautiful picture they had ever seen 

the picture was in the great vault of a room in a celestial palace it 
was carved of diamond emerald ruby jasper amethyst sardonyx and 
chrysolite through the walls of gem the stars shone brightly but 
all of this was nothing compared to the creature in the room 

he carried with him power and majesty he looked something like a man 
but bore glory beyond intense his face shone like the sun blazing in 
full force his eyes flashed like lightning and his hair like radiant 
flame he wore a robe that looked as if it had been woven from solid 
light in his left hand was a luminous book written in letters of 
gold and in his right hand was a sharp double edged sword sheathed 
in fire and lightning 

the king was stunned it took him a long time to find words and then 
he shouted with all of his might 

you fool i ask you for a picture of evil and you bring me this it 
is true that fools rush in where angels fear to tread and that like 
unthinking beasts they do not hesitate to slander the glorious ones 
what do you have to say for yourself and for this picture i shall 
have an explanation now or i shall have your head 

barak looked up a tear trickling down his cheek your majesty do 
you not understand it is a picture of satan

explanation n an account of a situation which does not threaten the

in george macdonalds the princess and the goblin princess irene gets 
lost in her mountain home and finds a mysterious grandmother who 
gives her a silver ring attached to an invisibly fine strand of 
spidersilk and tells her that if she follows the thread irene will 
find her grandmothers room one time irene gets lost and follows the 
thread out of the house in and out of all kinds of dark and 
unfamiliar caverns deep inside a goblininfested mountain she finds 
the imprisoned minerboy curdie and brings him to her grandmother 
curdie follows along but cannot believe her strange account even in 
the room where irene claims to be speaking with her grandmother 
curdie sees only a dark and dirty garret a bitter argument ensues 
and curdie returns home vexed 

his mother coaxes the explanation out of him 

then curdie made a clean breast of it and told them everything 

they all sat silent for some time pondering the strange tale at 
last curdies mother spoke 

you confess my boy she said there is something about the 
whole affair you do not understand 

yes of course mother he answered i cannot understand how a 
child knowing nothing about the mountain or even that i was shut 
up in it should come all that way alone straight to where i was 
and then after getting me out of the hole lead me out of the 
mountain too where i should not have known a step of the way if it 
had been as light as in the open air 

then you have no right to say what she told you was not true she 
did not take you out and she must have had something to guide her 
why not a thread as well as a rope or anything else there is 
something you cannot explain and her explanation may be the right 
one

feminism n like most philosophical and ideological currents truth 
gone mad 

feminism at its heart embodies a substantial truth that women have 
historically been treated as second class citizens if even that and 
that no society can call itself just while conducting business as 
usual and its development tells many other truths love 
nurturance and cooperation are foundational virtues in the life of a 
society emotion is an integral part of being human human 
relationships and community are important pornography degrades women 
and children and promotes rape no means no 

however both first wave feminism which sought equality on existing 
terms and second wave feminism which seeks to completely redefine 
the terms of equality make statements that if carried to their 
logical conclusions are absolute madness to which many feminists 
would reply that logic is a tool of male oppression 

at the root of this is a failure to identify the moral structure of 
the universe as ordered by a god who is the ultimate of masculinity 
more yang than yang and a failure to recognize femininity as a 
created good which by its very nature does not and should not order 
the universe first wave feminism did not understand the differences 
between masculine and feminism the second wave sees all good in terms 
of the feminine and all evil in terms of the masculine 

thus is embarked upon a project to remake society which consists 
entirely of male oppression into a world of feminine good the 
results vary from the comedic to the destructive and end up to be 
at least as baneful to women as men 

to be swept away are all of the classics of literature and philosophy 
their purpose is to justify the exploitation of women mens languages 
are to be replaced by feminine tongues they revolve around logic 
rather than emotion and are cruelly imposed on little girls before 
they can learn to communicate by their own natures never mind that 
women talk more than men or that the study of languages is dominated 
by women our languages are oppressive newtons principia 
mathematica the landmark work which laid out the foundations of 
calculus is newtons rape manual 

of course nearly all movements have a lunatic fringe but it is 
unnecessary to look at feminisms fringes to see the destructive 
many many women are told to regard every man as a potential rapist 
trust is essential to every human relationship it is a building block 
as foundational as love and honesty yet feminism believes it in the 
best interest of women to regard every moment with every man as 
potentially turning into one of the deepest and inhuman violations 
possible this means that they are to spend every moment with every 
man in unending fear 

furthermore at least a certain form of feminism like 
multiculturalism relativism etc in that they form a core of 
orthodoxy which the herd of free thinkers is shocked and indignant to 
see someone go against never mind for example that early feminism 
and the present black womanist movement found and find abortion to be 
unacceptable anyone who stands against the legality of abortion is an 
abortion rights foe just imagine what would happen if anyone used 
language that loaded in reference to a liberal who stands in the 
way of what can only be seen as a womans private rights over her own 
body never mind that other cultures even those which have had 
substantial impact from other peoples are not multicultural and do 
not see the multiplicity of existant cultures as suggesting that 
everything is arbitrary no one way of thinking or acting to be 
preferred over any other the existence of other cultures which see 
things differently is proof that everything is an arbitrary matter for 
which there can be no standard of judgement never mind that there 
are a great many things such as the natural law and the absence of 
our optimistic belief in human progress which remain remarkably 
constant across various cultures and ages and relativism of course 
means relativism on some very specific points namely everything 
that forms a part of this core of orthodoxy is something that no 
openminded person could seriously question and every belief which 
could substantially challenge the core of orthodoxy is a relative and 
subjective opinion which anybody may hold on condition that it is not 
actually believed to be true upon even a few minutes of inspection 
it would appear that these beliefs are not only furnished by a zeal 
not matched by thought but are not even internally consistent 

but all of this doesnt really matter because feminism and its 
cousins are not meant to be thought about only fought for 

with allies and a supporting movement like this what woman needs 
enemies

freedom n one of the foundational aspects of the christian walk its 
proper understanding is one of the pivotal themes of galatians a book 
which refutes a heresy that shocked paul so greatly that he skipped 
the usual pleasantries in beginning his letter there are two major 
historical interpretations both of which in some form or other can 
claim many orthodox adherents 

the first the libertine interpretation states that due to grace and 
forgiveness there are really no behaviors a christian should avoid 
hence the believer is free to participate in orgies free to have 
conduct dictated by an addiction free to touch molten iron and so 
on 

the second the judaizing interpretation states that grace and 
forgiveness make sense only if there is such a thing as sin and have 
an extensive list of sins to avoid at the same time the essence of 
their teaching is freedom hence the believer is free at least one 
day in seven to drop an article of clothing once every few steps 
free to have conduct dictated by a written code of rules free to 
become castrated and so on 

both of these emphasize freedom as the center of their walk there is 
rumored to be a third interpretation but it does not claim enough 
adherents to be worth explaining

this book is the origin of the words running a big government is 
like frying a small fish popular among republicans there are also 
statements that democrats would like but democrats do not believe in 
reading books a small fish is fried without being cut up or cleaned 
that is to say with a minimum of interference hence republicans like 
to quote the words as a reason to avoid spending money on social 
programs and other uses that they dislike spending ample money on 
programs that they do like such as military expenditures and

gnosticism n a major early christian era heresy at its root 
gnosticism contained the idea that the spiritual is good but the 
physical is evil 

perhaps the most deadly aspect of gnostic error was the denial of 
christs manhood knowing that christ was fully divine and believing 
that the physical was evil gnostics deduced that christ could not 
possibly have been a carnal creature like you and me with real 
tangible flesh they even went so far as to declare christs body to 
be an illusion 

only slightly less problematic was the denial of the fact that god 
himself created the material word as good the psalms thank him for 
his gifts of bread oil and wine the depths of the sea and the stars 
of the sky declare the glory of their creator paul quoted the psalms 
as saying the earth is the lords and everything in it 
encouraging believers to eat whatever was sold in the meat market 
without raising any question on ground of conscience so far from 
believing that the material world was created by god as good some 
gnostics went so far as to state that satan created it when god wasnt 
looking they embraced a patently false dichotomy between the physical 
and the spiritual the word scathing is perhaps an understatement in 
describing some of pauls reactions 

now the spirit expressly says that in later times some will 
renounce the faith paying attention to deceitful spirits and the 
teachings of demons through the hypocrisy of liars whose 
consciences are seared with a hot iron they forbid marriage and 
demand abstinence from foods which god created to be received by 
those who believe and know the truth for everything created by god 
is good and nothing is to be rejected for it is sanctified by 
gods word and by prayer

gnostic heresy has fortunately been eradicated and the churchs 
abstimeniousness ever since serves as an inspiration to us all

guard n an armed brute entrusted with the responsibility of 
keeping people from escaping imprisonment a complete set of rules 
around the insufficient set established in scripture given limited 
support in i cor and deut due to the fallenness of human 
nature the fact that we do not live in a perfect world and the 
powerlessness of the holy spirit the naive and simplistic ideas 
generated by gods inferior wisdom are not enough a guard around the 
law is necessary in order to prevent transgression against the moral 
laws while few have managed to duplicate the exacting precision and 
completeness of the pharisees guard around the law it must be said 
that there are many who are carrying on their worthy tradition

heretic n one who while appreciating the overall truth of the 
christian message is wiser than god and recognizes certain errors in 
orthodox theology these errors usually occur at some point where god 
misinterpreted the nature of love 

jesus summarized the law in the commandments to love god and neighbor 
and the teaching of the apostles retained this we are bestowed grace 
the outpouring of gods love a love which is to transform and fill 
us love for neighbor is so important that oftentimes the way to 
love god is through obeying the commandment love your neighbor in 
the sermon on the mount jesus said if you are in the temple 
offering a sacrifice and remember that your brother has something 
against you go leave your sacrifice on the altar and be reconciled 
with your brother heretics have generally retained an understanding 
of the central importance of love for a neighbor and offer a better 
way to do so 

it seems as time passes that the zeitgeist is a continual source of 
heresy of course it is not the only one and most major heresies 
have been able to claim at least a few adherents for most of time but 
the spirit of the time seems to aid the most people in recognizing 
that the bible is an old book and bring christian thought and 
application of the law of love into accordance with the most recent 
discoveries 

in the nineteenth century and early twentieth the law of the jungle 
was understood and lovingly applied to human affairs in the wild 
only the strong shall survive it seems harsh but is far more 
merciful than mercy it is sad for a weakling to be killed it is 
conceded but necessary if the weaklings survive to pass on their 
inferior genes it is whole future generations which are doomed to be 
weakened and experience a slow and painful death mercy is penny wise 
and pound foolish even when people arent killed there is often 
something to be done to make sure that they do not infest future 
generations with their inferior seed hence the involuntary 
sterilization of the mentally retarded by eliminating mercy and 
allowing all those who would pass genetic disease and infirmity to be 
preyed upon it is possible to ensure that future generations are 
strong healthy and happy this was believed to be the best way to 
apply love 

now even among people who believe casuistry to be the best way to 
adhere to moral imperatives that misinterpretation is passe it is 
recognized that people are equal and have a right to live and that 
different is not necessarily evil from this it is deduced that being 
different automatically precludes the possibility of evil and if 
people are equal then all tendencies are equally good equally 
consistent with a state of health and fullness of life equally 
resultant from the state of a person in good physical mental and 
spiritual health paul was mistaken when he having declared 
redemption for sinners and a life of freedom and joy to those who 
submit their sinfulness to gods grace declared homosexual practice 
to be inconsonant with holy living past generations were wrong to 
burn homosexuals at the stake we avoid their error by recognizing 
that homosexual practice was created by god as good as evidenced by 
the words from genesis which jesus quoted to answer the question about 
divorce he created them male and female

homo sapiens n lat man the knowing the scientific name for man 

common men seem to have no difficulty deciding is that entity over 
there a man or a beast 

to scientists and philosophers though it is not such a 
straightforward question they are in pursuit of the one action which 
sets apart man from the beasts 

some value technology measuring the progress of a civilizations 
culture morality and character by the machines it produces thus 
the distinguishing feature between man and beast is the ability to use 
tools but even some birds use twigs in order to get food 

now language seems to be the prime locus of attention the 
distinguishing feature is the use of words that is symbols to 
communicate but dolphins do that so its really the ability to put 
words or symbols together in new grammatical combinations or at 
least was until it was discovered that a chimpanzee can do that too 

this present lexicographer is unaware of any beasts which consider it 
necessary to spend time arguing about what it is that sets them apart 
from other species let alone understand doing and being accident and 
substance well enough to confuse them

hymn n the sacred song of the reformations where the teachings of 
the priesthood of the believer and the holiness of everyday living are 
applied to the realm of music 

the music of the catholic church was and is beautiful ancient 
powerful stately and majestic nobody had accused rome of disgracing 
god by poor taste in music the reason that the reformers used 
different music was as an application of another part of their 
theology 

the reformers held to the priesthood of the believer they believed 
that a farmer as well as a missionary can and should draw close to 
god to this end they translated the scriptures into the common 
tongue to reach people where they were they also held belief in the 
sanctity of everyday living prayer and study of the scriptures are 
the sacred privelege and duty of the believer but the believer also 
gives glory to god by eating and drinking working and playing 
pulling these thoughts together they used popular tunes as the medium 
to carry teaching in verse although the songs lacked any complexity 
the musical equivalent of flat soda and cannot honestly be 
described as embodying good musical taste even those songs were taken 
and transformed the roman church had slowly fallen into the error of 
making christianity something far off boring and unintelligible 
sermons and odd songs with prayers and incantations in a dead 
language elite and aloof from the way that common people live the 
reformers wished to cleanse the church of this error the holy 
scriptures formerly available only in the latin of the vulgate 
versio were now rendered in the vulgar tongue and people began to 
sing of christs love to the tune of popular drinking songs all to 
reach out and place the gospel message before people meeting them 
where they are 

this beautiful thought has not been forgotten cherished hymns sung by 
the reformers have been passed down from generation to generation and 
used to keep christian youth from becoming entangled in the devils

idealistic adj philosophical usage holding the belief that 
there exist minds sensations and thought processes within those 
minds but not an external material world to which sensations 
correspond common usage a patronizing and condescending term 
used in reference to a person who holds unswervingly to the only moral 
standards there are implicitly declaring those beliefs to be as 
disconnected with reality as those of a person who is idealistic in 
the first sense 

what the word says is that such uncompromising faithfulness to the 
call of conscience is not to be praised at least not beyond 
halfinsults of he means well and his heart is in the right 
place but rather gently patted on the head and politely 
dismissed what the term means is that the speaker whose own 
compromised conduct has been brought to light by that of person 
referred to and suddenly looks very shabby indeed all the worse 
for its whitewash coat of noblesounding words about how we do not 
live in a perfect world and so on and so forth is not only 
justified in compromise and lowering of standards but actually doing 
a better job than someone who does not compromise the speaker is more 
truly on the mark and the idealistic one has the most praiseworthy 
intentions but misses the goal in an excess of misguided zeal to top 
it all off the word is not recognized as a pungent insult such as 
asinine or idiotic but pleasantly accepted as a simple statement 
of the way things are

kinder and gentler adj crueler and harsher 

it is obviously evil to beat or molest a child what is less obvious 
an ever so sweetly disguides sadism consists in a manner of parenting 
that is always pleasant and rosy 

the basis for parenting is love and a child is not a punching bag to 
scream at or hit after a bad day it is wrong to strike a child in 
anger and a spanking can only be right if it is more painful to the 
parent than the child 

that being true a parent who is loving and wise must chastise and 
administer painful discipline as a tool of correction he who fails to 
do this raises a child who is spoiled 

this child will not understand consequence on anything more than an 
immediate physical level he will not burn himself by placing his hand 
on a hot stove only because his parents lack the power to make the 
action painless in all other areas conduct towards other people 
thievery promiscuity he will do whatever seems most attractive at 
the moment the belief that some things are worth a wait or the idea 
of action bearing consequence especially a delayed consequence that 
does not come by physical mechanism is a foreign concept and so 
when the child could be entering into life he is instead trapped in 
the abyss of self

the holy spirit to become the mother of jesus beyond that there is 
considerable discrepancy over issues such as whether she retained 
perpetual virginity and to what extent it is appropriate to venerate 
her 

protestants holding to sola scriptura note that there is relatively 
little mention of mary in the scriptures they deny her perpetual 
virginity and regard veneration of her as idolatrous taking their 
position from luke and particularly verse 

catholic and orthodox believers who hold to both the authority of 
scripture and tradition point primarily to tradition they venerate 
mary and hold the doctrine of her perpetual virginity and so on in 
order to offend protestants as they have spitefully done since the 
council of milan in they also refer to mary as the blessed virgin 
or theotokos and occasionally quote verses such as matt 
mark and luke 

in a sense both sides of the controversy have important concerns 
protestant believers fear that an overly strong mariology will detract 
from a proper christology taking away its central glory whereas 
catholic and orthodox christians feel that an overly weak mariology 
will detract from a proper christology taking away its central glory 
if they both stated those concerns first the debate over whether to 
have a strong christology or a strong christology would indubitably 
become far more intense and generate more light than heat 

as things stand though it is fortunate that all agree to the 
emphatic teaching whether derived from scripture alone or both from 
scripture and tradition stated in rom and i cor

metacognition n that mode of thought which among other things 
permits men to think about and apply to others that which they have 
carefully reasoned and applied to themselves the results of its 
affliction are seen in the following biercian definition 

christian n one who believes that the new testament is a divinely 
inspired book admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his 
neighbor 

this vice is one of the most deadly forms of thought it sometimes 
stops people from being at ease with themselves and causes them to 
raise questions it was with great discernment that the catholic and 
shortly after breaking away protestant church saw the need for 
scriptural interpretation handled exclusively by the church and not by 
the individual believer private interpretation brings with it some 
very real dangers the prime of these dangers is the possibility 
however remote that a private reader may read some troublesome 
portion of scripture perhaps the sermon on the mount perhaps the 
book of galatians and fall into the trap of thinking and acting as 
if they mean what they say they mean and getting it right 

this concern of course is not exclusively a plague to theology it 
endangers other modes of thought even philosophy some might begin to 
question relativism or believe that there might be morals which do not 
really depend on perspective postmodernism is the great white light 
by which we have been able to see progressing far beyond the 
benighted folly of those who lived before us and properly reshaping 
history so that it appears in its true nonform there are some who 
even dare to suggest that it may have internal problems as bad as 
those of logical positivism 

the vice is fortunately a very rare one most people accept as 
infallible the nonsensus of popular opinion or at least believe that 
they are not intelligent or wise enough to question it and succeed in 
protecting the few areas that thought uninvitedly intrudes with an sep 
field

pax n lat peace this word is occasionally used to refer to 
specific cases of peace such as the pax romana and the pax americana 
it also has meaning within a religious context in reference to the 
kiss of peace 

the language used in the new testament in reference to the believers 
is not one of separated people who happen to share beliefs 
maintaining a curtain of isolation and afraid to come near each other 
it is instead a family the picture painted is one of an intimate 
community language that referred to the believers as brothers and 
sisters was used in scripture and repeated in the words and 
lifestyles of the early christians 

in this sense it is not at all surprising that the apostles wrote 
their letters to the churches and along the practical instructions 
usually included towards the end included personal greetings by 
name and commanded a warm embrace greet one another with a holy 
kiss greet one another with a holy kiss greet one another with a 
holy kiss greet all the saints in christ jesus greet all the 
brothers and sisters with a holy kiss greet those who love us in 
the faith greet all your leaders and all gods people greet one 
another with a kiss of love greet the friends by name 

the kiss of peace began to be formalized as a part of the liturgy the 
scriptures certainly do not forbid a greeting within such a context 
but the kiss of peace is never mentioned in connection with any 
ceremony as centuries passed it somehow seemed not to occur too much 
outside of the ceremony after a few centuries in order to avoid 
impropriety the practice was modified so that only men were permitted 
to greet men an only women were permitted to greet women but that 
still involved touching and so there appeared a most interesting 
invention an object called the pax 

the pax was a small pendant or amulet worn for the sake of services 
it was held out to be kissed 

and so the troublesome command to greet one another with a holy 
kiss was thus dealt with in an ingenious manner which obviated any 
occasion for people to touch each other 

it is fortunate that this manner of dealing with the wisdom laid out 
in scripture has not occured anywhere else

peace through strength n establishing peace according to your own 
terms by ensuring that your nation has superior military powers to 
those of its neighbors with the advent of nuclear weaponry peace 
through strength has taken a new step forward and now also bears the 
title of mutually assured destruction 

paradoxically this is actually not as absurd as it initially sounds 
it works remarkably well due to an essential unity of spirit among the 
nations peace is desirable that is the almost unequivocal consensus 
military strength is the best way to achieve this again the 
nations consensus 

thus each nation attempts to establish a military that is a safe 
margin greater than the forces of its neighbors this helps prepare 
for the resolution of any misunderstandings that might arise in 
addition the resulting friendly competition does wonders for the

peter principle n a piercing insight into the function of american 
business 

the peter principle states in essence that individuals in an 
organization will rise to their level of incompetence that is to say 
a person who demonstrates competence in one field will be promoted 
a promotion consists of an increase in pay and hours of time expected 
to complete responsibilities combined with a shifting of 
responsibilities to another field requiring a different skill and 
talent this philosophy of promotion holds that the various functions 
within an organization which may be likened to parts of a body 
are to be ranked and ordered so that when one part excels at being 
itself it is considered to be evidently good at being the next part 
up a bicep muscle which proves its strength and stamina is surgically 
removed from the upper arm and reattached to the end of the wrist and 
expected to grasp and do fine manipulation a nose which keenly picks 
up faint odors is transplanted to the eye socket and expected to see 
thus the more competent an individual demonstrates himself in 
handling one set of responsibilities the more likely he will be to be 
reassigned to another field where he is incompetent see also

pinnacle n the highest point to literal usage the pinnacle of the 
mountain etc has been added figurative usage the pinnacle of his 
career etc to refer to the highest point which cannot get any 
higher 

it is illuminating in this case to look at synonyms and antonyms 
the idea of a highest crowning top point is expressed by a number of 
synonyms from apex to zenith it is then perhaps all the more notable 
that antonyms expressing the concept of a sunken abyss from which it 
is not possible to get lower simply do not exist 

this fact is in the view of this present lexicographer not a 
coincidence words appear in number variety and subtlety to suit the 
needs of the people using them hence the eskimos have approximately 
twenty different words referring to different kinds of snow and we 
whose lives are not nearly so directly affected have only made a 
couple powder slush words are used to express concepts that 
reflect peoples thought and there is perhaps very good reason that

priest n a man of special sanctity imbued with the authority to 
serve as an intermediary between man and god 

the priestly office is very clearly outlined in the old testament the 
priests uniquely holding the authority to offer sacrifices to enter 
into holy places and to consume sacred foods the highest priest 
once each year was permitted through the blood of a sacrificial 
victim to enter into the most sacred of places the holy of holies 

the new testament speaks also of priesthood the old testament 
sacrifices were a shadow anticipating the things to come for 
christianity is to know priestly office in its fullest christ is the 
ultimate priest having a priesthood after the order of melchizedek 
both priest and victim who offered the one perfect sacrifice for all 
time by the most precious blood he entered into the holy of holies

speaking out against the government a punishable offense thus one of

protestant adj and n a believer who is not catholic or orthodox 
unlike the other two protestants do not have a continuous line from 
the beginning rather they broke off sometimes voluntarily 
sometimes involuntarily from the catholic church believing that the 
adherence to tradition was inappropriately obscuring scriptural 
teaching such as jamess doctrine of salvation by faith and faith 
alone they held to the doctrine of sola scriptura meaning that they 
would not take tradition as a basis for doctrine but instead only use 
the scriptures which supported their views today still holding 
strongly to sola scriptura and other important traditions they have 
seminaries attendance to which is requisite to clerical positions 
which teach the faith from extensive creeds and confessions designed 
to remove the confusing task of directly interpreting the scriptures

puppy n a warm and soft animal handled and enjoyed by people who are 
afraid to touch each other 

for an infant touch is every bit as important a need as food and 
protection from the elements if not moreso a baby deprived of touch 
will quite literally wither and die 

if a puppy is taken into some place with a lot of people there will 
be a shower of people wanting to pet it part of this is due to how 
cute it is and it must be said that there is nothing which feels 
quite like a puppys fur at the same time there is another factor 
also at play 

handling a puppy purring cat guinea pig or some other agreeable 
furball is one of a few situations where social mores are actually 
willing to interpret an innocent touch as an innocent touch there are 
allowances made for exceptional circumstances such as moments of 
great sorrow and the handling of young children but even these are 
not entirely steady it is actually illegal in some states for a 
kindergarden teacher to give a student a hug so fervent is the legal 
zeal to avoid sexual misconduct 

thus we have embraced the age old style of solving problems so 
greatly concerned with respecting peoples space and as touch rightly 
plays a vital role in marital union avoiding what could possibly be 
taken to be unwanted sexual advances that human contact is deemed 
expendable and unnecessary a frying pan which we must jump out of at 
all costs see also pax purity victorianism wealth

purity n a virtue to be found in that which is free of any taint of 
evil purity should pervade not only actions but thought its 
relentless pursuit is perhaps best illustrated by the following story 
which has come to us from buddhist folklore 

there were two monks finally returning to their monastery at the 
end of a long trip they were passing through a wooded region 
forest with scattered paths and villages 

walking along the road they came to a large clearing cutting 
through the clearing was a river with stepping stones across 
there had been a great storm the night before and the river was 
flowing swiftly sweeping over its banks and the stepping stones 

there was a young woman standing on the near side of the river 
holding a bundle of firewood clearly wanting to cross the river 
but terrified to do so not trusting her light frame against the 
currents 

the older of the two monks who was a tall and very stout fellow 
set down his walking stick and walked over he picked the girl up 

slosh slosh slosh he still had to try to maintain his balance 
but he got to the other side and set her down 

slosh slosh slosh he picked up his staff and then continued 
walking with the other monk 

after about an hour the younger monk spoke 

i know that you are older and wiser than i and perhaps i should 
not be speaking but there is something that i wonder 

speak my child 

to be a monk means to take a vow of celibacy perhaps i do not 
understand but was it right for you to hold a young girl like 
that 

the older monk walked a few steps and then drew a deep breath 
finally he spoke 

oh my child are you still carrying her

renaissance n a time of intellectual rebirth when many things 
from philosophy to art were rethought and infused with new energy 

the movement in art is perhaps most striking on one level there was 
an awesome mastery of technical detail from the use of perspective to 
da vincis subtle use of blue to create distance in the madonna of the 
rocks 

the skill which they used succeeded in creating more convincing 
illusions than ever before the term renaissance masters is quite 
justly applied to these artists but the most profound rethinking of 
renaissance art was not on a technical level 

jesus was a middle eastern peasant with calloused hands and skin 
darkened by years beating in the sun the renaissance masters 
invariably showed him to be a soft and fair skinned caucasian who 
most definitely did not look jewish the jews in the rare instance 
that they were painted were a symbol of conniving greed and 
rejection of everything that is good and so they knew far better than 
to paint jesus as a darkskinned jew 

jesus was a carpenter by profession and he completely violated 
peoples expectations of a rabbi he chose disciples but not from the 
scribes and lawyers the educated and literate instead he chose a 
very motley crew of manual laborers fishermen and whatnot even one 
terrorist thrown in for good measure the renaissance masters in 
painting the disciples knew that jesus would only choose men attired 
in dignity his disciples are invariably painted as greek 
philosophers 

his birth was announced to shepherds in one of the great images of 
the last being first a shepherd was crude dirty smelly and 
uncouth he could outswear a roman soldier and his testimony was not 
legally valid in a court of law they might be described as the 
ancient equivalent of used car salesmen except for the fact that the 
modern used car salesman does not have quite that bad of a reputation 
from the renaissance onwards the image of the shepherd has been used 
as an image of the pastoral to symbolize everything that is calm 
serene peaceful and idyllic the angels are painted as joining this 
beautiful scene to sing of the newborn messiah because of how perfect 
it is 

an angel as described in scripture is invariably majestic awesome 
and terrifying their first words are almost always fear not to 
calm the great fear that comes in response to such a magnificent 
creature of power and light when they appeared at the resurrection 
their presence was sufficient to make soldiers faint from terror and 
john after seeing all things in revelation fell down at the angels 
feet to worship him the renaissance masters had the skill of brush to 
capture something of this majesty and painted angels as voluptuous 
women whose clothing is always falling off 

the renaissance masters would be pleased to see the wonders of 
television news reporting

rsv n revised standard version in the first edition a dangerous 
mistranslation heretically discordant with the authority of popular 
opinion 

from the reactions it received one might be tempted to think that they 
gave an accurate rendition of a comment paul made in phillippians 
paul listed many reasons he had to be confident on his own without 
need of grace born into the tribe of benjamin circumcised on the 
eighth day perfect in maintaining ceremonial law flawless in 
pharisaic legalism ad nauseum a couple of verses later he commented 
on their real value furthermore i consider everything a loss next 
to the surpassing greatness of knowing christ jesus my lord for whose 
sake i have lost all things i consider them all shit that i may gain 
christ he was perhaps contemplating the rebuke of the divine through 
the prophet malachi 

and now o priests this commandment is for you if you will not 
listen if you will not lay it to heart to give glory to my name 
says yahweh sabaoth then i will send the curse on you truly i 
have already cursed them because you do not lay it to heart i 
will wither your offspring and spread shit on your faces the shit 
of your solemn feasts and drive you out of my presence 

or perhaps the words of the prophet isaiah who compared righteous 
acts to a used tampon 

a like reaction might be be generated by rendering the crowds words 
about jesus crucify him in words the same hate took over a 
millenium later he is a faggot burn him at the stake perhaps 
there were footnotes explaining that the word stauros in its various 
forms was not merely a pejorative term but an obscenity 

or perhaps a dynamic equivalent of the song of songs rendering the 
sexual metaphors and double entendres in fresh english perhaps they 
might have rendered his banner over me is love in a less literal 
manner more understandable to the modern reader so that sunday 
school teachers would be less sorely tempted to set it to an annoying 
tune and teach it as a song to young children perhaps they departed 
from the victorian classic describing that which is described between 
the legs and belly and likened to a rounded goblet flowing with wine 
the womans navel 

but they did none of these choosing an error far worse 

in hebrew the word meaning young woman was spoken with the implicit 
understanding that the young woman is a virgin the prophet isaiah 
recorded the word of yahweh behold the young woman shall be 
pregnant and shall give birth to a son and call his name emmanuel 
rsv in its first edition not only rendered the word as young woman 
with a footnote saying or virgin but placed in footnotes rather 
than the main text various verses which are not found in the most 
ancient and reliable manuscripts preceding the editing work of 
erasmus in creating the textus receptus 

as a result the rsv became a banned book it was held up and waved 
around as the latest communistmarxisttrying to subvert the doctrine 
of the virgin birthhereticalcatholicinfiltration en masse 

this prompted the creation of rsv second edition a work less 
offensive to such staunch christians

sensitivity n one of the prime concerns of administrators and 
directors who desire to use their power and authority in such a 
manner as to benefit those under their authority in order to effect 
this proper use of power it is important to be attuned to the needs 
and desires of those people it is an administrators business not to 
be aloof this quality is best demonstrated in an immortal story from 
hacker folklore 

in the beginning was the board of directors and the board of 
directors formed the administration and the administration formed 
a committee and the committee formed the plan 

the board of directors believed that the plan was good but wished 
to be sensitive to the hackers they did not wish to use the plan 
except that the hackers approved 

so they sent memos explaining the plan and low level 
administration summoned the hackers to set aside their work and 
attend meetings to find what the hackers thought of the plan 

you the hackers are our lifes blood our strength as a 
corporation depends on you you are the source of our success and 
we hold the highest regard and appreciation for your wisdom now 
you have had time to read and meditate upon the plan what do you 
think is the plan a good or a bad idea 

its a crock of shit and it stinks 

then middle level administration summoned low level administration 
to set aside their work of wasting the time of the hackers and 
attend meetings to explain what the hackers think of the plan 

you have spoken with the hackers the hackers are very 
intelligent and have many good ideas what do they say of the 
plan 

it is manure and the stench thereof is great 

then upper level administration summoned middle level 
administration to set aside their work and attend meetings to 
explain what the hackers think of the plan 

you have spoken with those who have condensed the wise and good 
ideas of the hackers what do the hackers say of the plan 

it is fertilizer and it smells of great power 

then the board of directors summoned upper level administration to 
set aside their work and attend meetings to explain what the 
hackers think of the plan 

you know the wisdom and understanding of the hackers and what 
they believe of the plan our time is scarce so we are certain 
that you can explain their reactions briefly what do the hackers 
say of the plan 

it promoteth growth and the vigor thereof is exceedingly great 

whereby the board of directors was greatly pleased to learn that 
the hackers appreciated the value efficiency and wisdom of the 
plan 

and the plan was approved and made action

sex n one of the godgiven blessings of which different cultures are 
most universally intolerant 

the most obvious example of this is found in the most ridiculously 
idiotic monument of victorian culture victorian thought held that 
because the marriage bed is private it is to be an object of shame 
while claiming to be christian victorian thought flaunted a blatant 
disregard for the song of songs an extended commentary on the words 
in genesis male and female he created them and two shall become 
one and utterly ignored pauls words commanding that the husband 
and wife should yield to each others conjugal rights the victorian 
mind found sex to be at best an unfortunate but necessary evil in 
order to produce children hence in a letter to a newlywed bride a 
minister commanded that she give occasionally give sparingly and 
give grudgingly what they were to have as sex precluded the 
possibility of seeing each others bodies and if the husband began 
to fondle or kiss anywhere not strictly necessary in order to produce 
children the wife was suddenly to excuse herself 

current american culture by contrast considers sex to be a faceless 
underclothed and underweight model holding a product in an 
advertisement or taken further still little more than a cheap 
thrill to toy with when other forms of amusement become boring sex 
is not a cherished bond a union of body mind and soul that 
encompasses conversation and silent walks as well as foreplay and 
intercourse best described by the word know this present 
lexicographer is reminded of monks who used pieces of the oldest known 
septuagint manuscript to start fires 

people who have cohabited and quickly introduced intercourse to 
romance wonder why sex after marriage seems a contradiction in terms 
along with adulterers they are befuddled at why it is so difficult to 
keep a marriage together even the people who recognize certain limits 
are inclined to ask how far can i go rather than how much do i 
want to have left 

the harm stemming from a culture using pornographic magazines and 
casual sex is not that its people experience too much sex but that 
they experience too little 

herein lies a very illuminating glimpse of american culture

sola scriptura n lat sola only scriptura scripture a momentous 
doctrine of the reformation holding that only the scriptures are to 
be used as a basis for teaching 

scripture has held an important role in church history it is 
godbreathed and profitable for teaching and rebuking in its 
entirety if a belief contradicts the unambiguous teaching of the 
scriptures it is an error only a heretic would hold so low of a 
regard for these sacred writings as to hold even one out and say of 
it it is a letter of straw burn it 

if the scriptures are to be magnified beyond being seen as a final 
resolution as to which doctrines are and are not acceptable and 
declared to be the only acceptable source of teaching then it is 
important to see what they are and what they do and do not say 

the scriptures are an anthology of a wide variety of sacred writings 
a definition is not the place to quote a thousand pages of truth but 
there are a few points which are notable here the scriptures do say 
that god himself speaks through the lips of prophets and the creation 
declares the glory of its creator they do not at any point give a 
listing of which works are to be considered canonical

sophia n gk wisdom which along with knowledge gnosis was 
considered by gnosticism to be the route to salvation the gnostic 
understanding of wisdom of attaining the spiritual by shunning the 
physical of balancing and then moving beyond good and evil of a 
christ whose prime purpose was to offer knowledge rather than to offer 
grace and so on was harshly attacked by the apostles and early 
fathers recent thought has found that some of these ideas are perhaps 
better than they were thought to be and bits and pieces have slowly 
been brought into christian thought the work is far from complete of 
course but there have been many steps to follow in the path of the 
gnostics and wholeheartedly embrace a system of ideas worth its weight 
in gold

sorcerors bargain n a classic pact with the devil who offers i 
will give you power if you give me your soul but there is a problem 
aside from the obvious difficulty of the power having no value near 
that of the soul if you make the deal it isnt really you that has 
the power once the deal is made it is a loselose situation 

in the contemporary western world the sorcerors bargain is 
frequently made with two very attractive looking twin demons named 
mammon and technology 

both of them woo people with the sweetest promises never speaking of 
any price to be paid and both of them somewhere somehow find the 
most creative ways to extract payment and deliver more of an illusion 
than a reality of what they promised it is notable that in the 
sermon on the mount christs warning was not no man can own two 
slaves but no man can serve two masters

once upon a time a man came to a psychiatrist 

doc wherever i go whatever i look at all i can see or think of 
is sex sex sex can you tell me whats going on 

i think so but id like to run a few ink blot tests first im 
going to hold up some sheets of paper with colored spots and i 
want you to tell me what you see 

walking over to a shelf he pulled a binder and opening it began 
to hold up sheets of paper 

whats this a picture of 

sex 

ok whats this a picture of 

sex 

what about this one 

sex 

can you explain how 

yes right here you can see that the 

thirty forty fifty ink blots always the same response sex 
sex sex 

setting down the binder the psychiatrist opened his desk drawer 
and pulled out two sheets of paper from there one x 
blue lined sheet of notebook paper and one blank x sheet 
of typing paper 

all right those images are somewhat old and perhaps all look 
more or less the same i want you to clear your mind of all 
thought and then im going to hold up two more sheets of paper 
different from any of the ones before could you please tell me 
what you see 

the psychiatrist with one swift motion lifted both sheets off the 
desk holding them up in the air for the patient to see 

they are both graphic sexual images like all the rest 

even after profesional training the psychiatrist was somewhat 
taken aback he wasnt expecting that reaction caught off guard 
he said well um i see you do seem to have a one track mind 

hey doc youre the one whos drawing all of the dirty pictures

telephone n a very poor substitute for reaching out and touching 
someone 

in a personal conversation with a friend the text of what is said is 
of course important but there is more eye contact touch and body 
language are all carriers of personal presence of such things only 
tone of voice is preserved and even that is often garbled by line 
static 

as such telephone conversations are a distant and miserable rendering 
of enjoying another persons presence and it is no great surprise 
that a majority of them are terse and technical taking the necessary 
time to say what needs to get across but not really taking time to 
slow down and chat as reported by the chicago tribune fifty percent 
of phone calls are one way person to answering machine and 
fiftytwo percent of residential phone calls do not last for more than 
a minute people exchange brief messages and get tasks done but 
maintaining friendships and keeping in touch with family is something 
which seems to happen and if there is any real distance between the 
involved parties which is often why a phone call is used as a 
substitute for a personal visit it costs money by the minute touch 
eye contact body language and an unhurried and relaxed time are all 
vitally important and the telephone takes away all of these one 
might be tempted to forget all of this by advertising slogans that 
suggest touch and show the faces of family warmed by each others 
presence but it is still true 

all in all a quite perfect picture of how not to cultivate 
relationships with friends and family

thou pn in older english usage the familiar second person singular 
pronoun as contrasted to you the formal and plural second person 
pronoun 

in when the king james version was translated addresses to the 
godhead were rendered as thou this was not in any sense a denial of 
the glory and majesty of the king of kings but rather an accurate 
rendering of the intimacy of the original language marks account of 
the gospel preserves an arimaic word abba which jesus used to 
address the father and pauls writings mention that word as something 
which believers are to use in prayers the best modern equivalent is 
probably daddy it was a very important element of prayer and 
religion which was accurately preserved when the personal informal 
familiar intimate word thou was used to accurately render the 
corresponding words in the original language it was a very important 
element of christian teaching which was preserved when that same word 
was not simply left in scripture as a special case owing to the 
sanctity of the characters involved but an example to be repeated in 
prayers 

now the word has generally fallen out of use the one exception the 
one place where thou is still used is in formal prayer and liturgy 
where it is cherished for its elegance and stateliness

images play as focal of a role in current american culture as they did 
in the medieval european culture but the manner is different in 
medieval culture images were symbols in a cathedral stained glass 
windows and statues spoke a rich language and lore literature for the 
illiterate upon beholding images a host of meanings would occur a 
detail was all that was necessary for a single picture to tell a 
story the image was a trigger to thought now the image is a 
substitute for thought charisma has displaced reason 

this is candidly illustrated in the outcome of a recent election 
where one candidate fared poorly because though he was a decorated 
and courageous veteran his physical appearance was weak and 
unimpressive 

alternately it may be seen in a political commentator whose opinion 
and thought is held to be of immense weight by many americans it 
would perhaps be inaccurate to describe his figure as chiselled but 
his manner and personality enable people to believe through a 
scattering of sound bites and quotes out of context that he has the 
monopoly on the truth 

the sound bite itself has become the modern unit of debate in a land 
that once paid attention to involved political debates lasting for 
hours it is now expected that any argument deemed credible must be 
developped in seconds vivid language is certainly not an evil but 
neither is it a substitute for thought 

due to these trends it is chaos and charisma which carry the day 
once upon a time acting and politics were distinct professions 
now for a leader to be charismatic certainly does not preclude 
being an effective leader but neither does it guarantee wisdom in a 
sense though there is one point separating politics and public 
concensus from a racetrack

valor n the attribute embodying bravery and courage of a soldier 
who most truly serves his country without being deterred or 
intimidated by any threatening menace which stands in the way of the 
true cause 

once upon a time three generals one from the army one from the 
navy and one from the air force were discussing and debating 
the nature of courage the debate went through the day and long 
into the night and finally agreed to visit their respective 
bases in order to learn something there 

first they visited a pier driving in a car the navy general 
threw his watch into shallow water ordering a cadet to retrieve 
it 

the cadet looked at him in fright and then when the general 
repeated the order dove into the water retrieving the watch at 
the expense of severe injuries 

the general said that is courage 

the army general paused in thought for a moment and then said 
that is indeed the beginning of courage but there is a courage 
yet greater and so they went to an army base 

at the base as several tanks were driving by the general suddenly 
commanded private stop that tank 

the man immediately ran in front of the tank and stoically stood 
until the tank came and crushed him to death 

that is true courage 

the general from the air force said there is yet one base that we 
have not visited there is a sense of courage great courage 
which both of your forces have shown but there is a courage and a 
true patriotism which is greater still 

there was a long time of silence before one of the other generals 
finally said as you wish and drove to the air force base 

here at the beginning of a runway the air force general ordered 
the car stopped as a plane came in to land he barked out 
airman stop that plane now 

the young cadet immediately snapped to attention and gave the 
general a onefingered salute 

the general leaned back in his seat gentlemen that is courage

values n singular value generally not used a termusage chosen 
by postmodern philosophers such as nietzche embodying all of the 
genius of s newspeak 

the term designates religious or moral beliefs but like a great many 
words means far more than it designates the meaning of the word is 
that one makes a category mistake in actually regarding such beliefs 
as corresponding or not corresponding to an external reality they are 
rather a strictly internal state like a persons emotional state one 
does not speak of right or wrong values one rather speaks of a 
persons values just as one speaks of a persons tastes and 
preferences as an arbitrary and subjective attribute of that 
individual person the word places such beliefs within that basic 
category 

thus from the outset any discussion is biased no worse than 
biased a bias presents a difficulty to surmount while values 
presents a closed door against a meaningful consideration of god 
or of the moral structure of the universe even the term atheism 
does not quite contain what this does to the discussion atheism says 
there is an ultimate reality to which beliefs do or do not 
correspond god does not exist beliefs in god are false and this 
facet of postmodernism in its definition of values cant go far 
enough to say that a belief does or does not correspond to reality 
words such as good evil right wrong heroism adultery 
honesty theft and so on arent even allowed to be wrong in what 
they describe they describe not an external moral reality but only a 
persons internal state 

it can at least be said that a part of this usages proper meaning is 
dropped by some speakers who perhaps do not think far enough to 
cringe at hearing the words our values but even then this 
lexicographer cannot recall a single instance of someone referring to 
values as being right or wrong

victorianism n the death knell to sexual purity in western culture 

victorianism held sexual purity to be extremely important all well 
and good but it did not stop there victorianism believed sexual 
purity to be best approached via a pharisaic guard around the law 
and like every other guard around the law it did a trememdous amount 
of damage to numerous other things before destroying the very object 
it was meant to preserve 

touch and community are vital elements of human health this is 
witnessed in scriptures that tell of john reclining in jesuss bosom 
and in the hands quickly extended to pets one of the few situations 
where our society will allow an innocent touch to be an innocent 
touch an infant who is not held will wither and die and 
psychologists have a bluntly accurate term for the failure of parents 
to hold and cuddle their children a great deal abuse and of course 
the special kind of community that exists between a husband and wife 
is given a special kind of touch 

victorianism looked at sex and did not quite see something which is 
fundamentally good within a certain context it saw something which 
was essentially evil but tolerable at best within a certain context 
and in progressively widening circles encompassing different forms 
of touch further and further from what is necessarily foreplay saw 
that there exists at least some possibility for that touch to be 
sexual at least from the perspective of the younger monk and placed 
on each one a label of this is dirty avoid it word such as greet 
one another with a kiss of love cease to be acknowledged as a divine 
command which was given for human good and instead look like um an 
odd cultural thing which um shows um um um 

the aim it appears was to end up with nothing that was sexual the 
result was to make everything sexual and create a major unanticipated 
problem 

god created people with certain needs and when those needs are not 
met satan comes in with counterfeit substitutes these things are 
hard enough to resist to someone whose needs are met with the genuine 
article when there is an immense sucking vacuum coming from unmet 
needs pushing away the counterfeits acquires a difficulty which is 
unbelieveable a little girl who is deprived of a fathers hugs and 
kisses will grow into a young woman who has a tremendously difficult 
time avoiding sexual promiscuity unsuccessfully searching in a series 
of abusive boyfriends embraces for enough love to fill the emptiness 
inside 

fortunately most of victorianism did not quite leave a stain that 
dark and deep but there is still a major problem with a culture that 
refuses to wholeheartedly say its ok you may enjoy an innocent 
touch as an innocent touch there is still a failure to meet a need 
that god created people to have filled and still an uphill battle to 
fight off the counterfeit substitutes 

in this century victorianism has crumbled but like every other 
evil it fails to crumble in the ways that a sane person would want it 
to crumble what disappeared was not the prohibition on friendly 
touch but the belief that sexual sin is a deadly poison which should 
be fought tooth and nail what appeared and took the place meant to be 
filled by innocent touch is something which is not innocent thus 
victorianism did a perfect job of making room and clearing the way for 
a great deal of lewdness 

current western culture is saturated with sexual sin not despite but 
because of the fact that it is the continuation of victorian culture

villain n one who is positive that his actions contribute positively 
to the betterment of mankind 

among people who embody some semblance of what might be termed good 
there is a continual selfsearch a continual question of am i doing 
good or evil the apostle paul said here is a trustworthy saying 
which deserves acceptance jesus christ died for sinners of whom i am 
the worst those people who act the most villainously do not ask the 
question because they know that they are doing good 

hence nazi germany knew that it was doing the world a favor by 
eradicating jews from the face of the earth the jews were the source 
of all the worlds problems hitler himself did not go to eradicate 
jews until after he had established himself as a national hero 
pulling germany out of a major depression and speaking love and 
appreciation to the common people and farmers as the heartblood of the 
aryan nation it is the opinion of this lexicographer that had 
hitler found a more productive use for his talents than genocide 
history would probably record him as a strong leader and a hero other 
groups since them such as the klueless klux klan are also positive 
of the immense benefit that their actions are bringing to america 
expurgating our white homeland of foreigners and helping to gently 
persuade them to go back to where they came from africa asia 
europe the present practitioners of ethnic cleansing wear watches 
reminding themselves of the defeat they suffered years ago and 
how they are merely returning just retribution and punishment to an 
evil that was done to them in wartime in order to justify the 
killing it is almost universal for one nation to demonize the people 
of the other country and make their dominant race subhuman entities 
which should be destroyed hence even after the tragedy of the viet 
nam war there was opposition to the chosen plan for a memorial 
because it was designed by an asian 

sometimes people do a more subtle job of making their actions look 
good the kkk now is not openly speaking about how other races are 
destroying our land they are instead speaking of the importance of 
hospitality and love towards whites the true americans the neighbors 
of child molesters and mass murderers frequently say things such as 
he seemed like such a nice man 

there is one common thread namely that these people are masterfully 
adept at fighting the evil out there and somehow never manage to look 
inside themselves to see if there might be evil in here

vote v to submit ones opinion to be counted as worthwhile

is of rejecting as inappropriate everything out of accord with the

have a zeitgeist instead of a party to tell us that we should burn 
books and we burn them not by throwing them into bonfires but by 
carefully keeping them in neat little rows in libraries making them 
accessible and inviting people to read them on condition that they 
are not consulted for serious consideration in academic work 

thus it is told to people i dont care if you have studied years of 
wisdom or are yourself a part of the years of wisdom i dont care if 
you took the time to write your thoughts down in a book that has 
endured so that i may understand your thoughts long after your body 
has turned to dust you didnt write it right now in accordance with 
the present whims of the zeitgeist so it isnt worth my time to 
read 

however america in its own special way does wish to keep a little 
of everything not to leave a snippet of some obscure ingredient out 
of the great melting pot there is thus one single place where the 
vote of a dead man is counted to be of equal weight to the vote of one 
who is alive knowledgeable and wise in the way things should be run
