preface 


the present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately in modern 
measures the venerable epic beowulf approximately i repeat for a 
very close reproduction of anglosaxon verse would to a large extent be 
prose to a modern ear 

the heynesocin text and glossary have been closely followed occasionally 
a deviation has been made but always for what seemed good and sufficient 
reason the translator does not aim to be an editor once in a while 
however he has added a conjecture of his own to the emendations quoted 
from the criticisms of other students of the poem 

this work is addressed to two classes of readers from both of these alike 
the translator begs sympathy and cooperation the anglosaxon scholar he 
hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original the student of 
english literature he aims to interest by giving him in modern garb the 
most ancient epic of our race this is a bold and venturesome undertaking 
and yet there must be some students of the teutonic past willing to follow 
even a daring guide if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of 
hrothgar of the prowess of beowulf and of the feelings that stirred the 
hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes 

in order to please the larger class of readers a regular cadence has been 
used a measure which while retaining the essential characteristics of 
the original permits the reader to see ahead of him in reading 

perhaps every anglosaxon scholar has his own theory as to how beowulf 
should be translated some have given us prose versions of what we believe 
to be a great poem is it any reflection on our honored kemble and arnold 
to say that their translations fail to show a layman that beowulf is 
justly called our first epic of those translators who have used verse 
several have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view is it 
proper for instance that the grave and solemn speeches of beowulf and 
hrothgar be put in ballad measures tripping lightly and airily along or 
again is it fitting that the rough martial music of anglosaxon verse be 
interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse do we hear 
what has been beautifully called the clanging tread of a warrior in 
mail 

viii 

of all english translations of beowulf that of professor garnett alone 
gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great 
teutonic epic 

the measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a 
reproduction of the original as modern english affords the cadences 
closely resemble those used by browning in some of his most striking 
poems the four stresses of the anglosaxon verse are retained and as 
much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular 
cadence alliteration has been used to a large extent but it was thought 
that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line endrhyme has 
been used occasionally internal rhyme sporadically both have some 
warrant in anglosaxon poetry for endrhyme see for 
internal rhyme 

what gummere calls the rimegiver has been studiously kept viz 
the first accented syllable in the second halfverse always carries the 
alliteration and the last accented syllable alliterates only 
sporadically alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the 
original see 

no two accented syllables have been brought together except occasionally 
after a csural pause see and or scientifically speaking 
sieverss c type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of 
translation several of his types however constantly occur eg a and 
a variant x x xx x b and a variant x x xx 
x a variant of d x xx e xx anacrusis gives 
further variety to the types used in the translation 

the parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved eg 
and lord and wielder of glory and 
and and occasionally some loss has been 
sustained but on the other hand a gain has here and there been made 

the effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the 
translation all words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have 
been avoided again though many archaic words have been used there are 
none it is believed which are not found in standard modern poetry 

ix 

with these preliminary remarks it will not be amiss to give an outline of 
the story of the poem 


the story 

hrothgar king of the danes or scyldings builds a great meadhall or 
palace in which he hopes to feast his liegemen and to give them presents 
the joy of king and retainers is however of short duration grendel the 
monster is seized with hateful jealousy he cannot brook the sounds of 
joyance that reach him down in his fendwelling near the hall oft and 
anon he goes to the joyous building bent on direful mischief thane after 
thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured while no one is found strong 
enough and bold enough to cope with the monster for twelve years he 
persecutes hrothgar and his vassals 

over sea a days voyage off beowulf of the geats nephew of higelac 
king of the geats hears of grendels doings and of hrothgars misery he 
resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king with 
fourteen chosen companions he sets sail for daneland reaching that 
country he soon persuades hrothgar of his ability to help him the hours 
that elapse before night are spent in beerdrinking and conversation when 
hrothgars bedtime comes he leaves the hall in charge of beowulf telling 
him that never before has he given to another the absolute wardship of his 
palace all retire to rest beowulf as it were sleeping upon his arms 

grendel comes the great marchstepper bearing gods anger he seizes 
and kills one of the sleeping warriors then he advances towards beowulf 
a fierce and desperate handtohand struggle ensues no arms are used 
both combatants trusting to strength and handgrip beowulf tears 
grendels shoulder from its socket and the monster retreats to his den 
howling and yelling with agony and fury the wound is fatal 

the next morning at early dawn warriors in numbers flock to the hall 
heorot to hear the news joy is boundless glee runs high hrothgar and 
his retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts 

grendels mother however comes the next night to avenge his death she 
is furious and raging while beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart 
x from the quarters of the other warriors she seizes one of hrothgars 
favorite counsellors and carries him off and devours him beowulf is 
called determined to leave heorot entirely purified he arms himself and 
goes down to look for the female monster after traveling through the 
waters many hours he meets her near the seabottom she drags him to her 
den there he sees grendel lying dead after a desperate and almost fatal 
struggle with the woman he slays her and swims upward in triumph taking 
with him grendels head 

joy is renewed at heorot congratulations crowd upon the victor hrothgar 
literally pours treasures into the lap of beowulf and it is agreed among 
the vassals of the king that beowulf will be their next liegelord 

beowulf leaves daneland hrothgar weeps and laments at his departure 

when the hero arrives in his own land higelac treats him as a 
distinguished guest he is the hero of the hour 

beowulf subsequently becomes king of his own people the geats after he 
has been ruling for fifty years his own neighborhood is wofully harried 
by a firespewing dragon beowulf determines to kill him in the ensuing 
struggle both beowulf and the dragon are slain the grief of the geats is 
inexpressible they determine however to leave nothing undone to honor 
the memory of their lord a great funeralpyre is built and his body is 
burnt then a memorialbarrow is made visible from a great distance that 
sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national 
hero of geatland 

the poem closes with a glowing tribute to his bravery his gentleness 
his goodness of heart and his generosity 



it is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the 
story of beowulf shall be as familiar to englishspeaking peoples as that 
of the iliad beowulf is our first great epic it is an epitomized history 
of the life of the teutonic races it brings vividly before us our 
forefathers of prealfredian eras in their love of war of sea and of 
adventure 

my special thanks are due to professors francis a march and james a 
harrison for advice sympathy and assistance

the life and death of scyld 


the famous race of speardanes 

lo the speardanes glory through splendid achievements 
the folkkings former fame we have heard of 
how princes displayed then their prowessinbattle 

scyld their mighty king in honor of whom they are often called 
scyldings he is the greatgrandfather of hrothgar so prominent in the 
poem 

oft scyld the scefing from scathers in numbers 
from many a people their meadbenches tore 
since first he found him friendless and wretched 
the earl had had terror comfort he got for it 
waxed neath the welkin worldhonor gained 
till all his neighbors oer sea were compelled to 
bow to his bidding and bring him their tribute 
an excellent atheling after was borne him 

a son is born to him who receives the name of beowulfa name afterwards 
made so famous by the hero of the poem 

a son and heir young in his dwelling 
whom godfather sent to solace the people 
he had marked the misery malice had caused them 
that reaved of their rulers they wretched had erstwhile 
long been afflicted the lord in requital 
wielder of glory with worldhonor blessed him 
famed was beowulf far spread the glory 
of scylds great son in the lands of the danemen 



the ideal teutonic king lavishes gifts on his vassals 

so the carle that is young by kindnesses rendered 
the friends of his father with fees in abundance 
must be able to earn that when age approacheth 
eager companions aid him requitingly 
when war assaults him serve him as liegemen 
by praiseworthy actions must honor be got 
mong all of the races at the hour that was fated 

scyld dies at the hour appointed by fate 

scyld then departed to the allfathers keeping 
warlike to wend him away then they bare him 
to the flood of the current his fondloving comrades 
as himself he had bidden while the friend of the scyldings 
wordsway wielded and the welllovd landprince 
long did rule them the ringstemmd vessel 
bark of the atheling lay there at anchor 
icy in glimmer and eager for sailing 

by his own request his body is laid on a vessel and wafted seaward 

the belovd leader laid they down there 
giver of rings on the breast of the vessel 
the famed by the mainmast a many of jewels 
of fretted embossings from farlands brought over 
was placed near at hand then and heard i not ever 
that a folk ever furnished a float more superbly 
with weapons of warfare weeds for the battle 
bills and burnies on his bosom sparkled 
many a jewel that with him must travel 
on the flush of the flood afar on the current 
and favors no fewer they furnished him soothly 
excellent folkgems than others had given him 

he leaves daneland on the breast of a bark 

who when first he was born outward did send him 
lone on the main the merest of infants 
and a goldfashioned standard they stretched under heaven 
high oer his head let the holmcurrents bear him 
seaward consigned him sad was their spirit 
their mood very mournful men are not able 

no one knows whither the boat drifted 

soothly to tell us they in halls who reside 
heroes under heaven to what haven he hied 

for the t of verse sievers suggests which if 
this be accepted the sentence he had afflicted will read he 
ie god had perceived the malicecaused sorrow which they 
lordless had formerly long endured 

for aldorlase gr suggested aldorceare he perceived 
their distress that they formerly had suffered lifesorrow a long 
while 

a very difficult passage hte has no object h supplies 
geweald from the context and our translation is based upon this 
assumption though it is far from satisfactory kl suggests 
lndagas for lange and the beloved landprince enjoyed had his 
transitory days ie lived b suggests a dislocation but this is 
a dangerous doctrine pushed rather far by that eminent scholar 

the reading of the hso text has been quite closely followed 
but some eminent scholars read slerdenne for selerdende if 
that be adopted the passage will read men cannot tell us indeed 
the order of fate etc selerdende has two things to support it 
v it affords a parallel to men in v

waxing of warfame that willingly kinsmen 
obeyed his bidding till the boys grew to manhood 
a numerous band it burned in his spirit 
to urge his folk to found a great building 
a meadhall grander than men of the era 

he is eager to build a great hall in which he may feast his retainers 

ever had heard of and in it to share 
with young and old all of the blessings 
the lord had allowed him save life and retainers 
then the work i find afar was assigned

grendel the murderer 


grendel attacks the sleeping heroes 

when the sun was sunken he set out to visit 
the lofty hallbuilding how the ringdanes had used it 
for beds and benches when the banquet was over 
then he found there reposing many a noble 
asleep after supper sorrow the heroes 
misery knew not the monster of evil 
greedy and cruel tarried but little 

he drags off thirty of them and devours them 

fell and frantic and forced from their slumbers 
thirty of thanemen thence he departed 
leaping and laughing his lair to return to 
with surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward 
in the dusk of the dawning as the day was just breaking 
was grendels prowess revealed to the warriors 

a cry of agony goes up when grendels horrible deed is fully realized 

then his mealtaking finished a moan was uplifted 
morningcry mighty the manruler famous 
the longworthy atheling sat very woful 
suffered great sorrow sighed for his liegemen 
when they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer 
the spirit accursd too crushing that sorrow 

the monster returns the next night 

too loathsome and lasting not longer he tarried 
but one night after continued his slaughter 
shameless and shocking shrinking but little 
from malice and murder they mastered him fully 
he was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for 
a pleasanter place of repose in the lodges 
a bed in the bowers then was brought to his notice 
told him truly by token apparent 
the hallthanes hatred he held himself after 
further and faster who the foeman did baffle 
so ruled he and strongly strove against justice 
lone against all men till empty uptowered 

king hrothgars agony and suspense last twelve years 

the choicest of houses long was the season 
twelvewinters time torture suffered 
the friend of the scyldings every affliction 
endless agony hence it after became 
certainly known to the children of men 
sadly in measures that long against hrothgar 
grendel struggledhis grudges he cherished 
murderous malice many a winter 
strife unremitting and peacefully wished he 
lifewoe to lift from no liegeman at all of 
the men of the danefolk for money to settle 
no counsellor needed count for a moment 
on handsome amends at the hands of the murderer 

grendel is unremitting in his persecutions 

the monster of evil fiercely did harass 
the illplanning deathshade both elder and younger 
trapping and tricking them he trod every night then 
the mistcovered moorfens men do not know where 
witches and wizards wander and ramble 
so the foe of mankind many of evils 
grievous injuries often accomplished 
horrible hermit heort he frequented 
gembedecked palace when nightshades had fallen 

god is against the monster 

since god did oppose him not the throne could he touch 
the lightflashing jewel love of him knew not 
twas a fearful affliction to the friend of the scyldings 

the king and his council deliberate in vain 

soulcrushing sorrow not seldom in private 
sat the king in his council conference held they 
what the braves should determine gainst terrors unlooked for 

they invoke the aid of their gods 

at the shrines of their idols often they promised 
gifts and offerings earnestly prayed they 
the devil from hell would help them to lighten 
their peoples oppression such practice they used then 
hope of the heathen hell they remembered 
in innermost spirit god they knew not 

the true god they do not know 

judge of their actions allwielding ruler 
no praise could they give the guardian of heaven 
the wielder of glory woe will be his who 
through furious hatred his spirit shall drive to 
the clutch of the fire no comfort shall look for 
wax no wiser well for the man who 
living his lifedays his lord may face 
and find defence in his fathers embrace

of this difficult passage the following interpretations among 
others are given though grendel has frequented heorot as a demon 
he could not become ruler of the danes on account of his hostility to 
god hrothgar was much grieved that grendel had not appeared

beowulf goes to hrothgars assistance 


hrothgar sees no way of escape from the persecutions of grendel 

so healfdenes kinsman constantly mused on 
his longlasting sorrow the battlethane clever 
was not anywise able evils to scape from 
too crushing the sorrow that came to the people 
loathsome and lasting the lifegrinding torture 

beowulf the geat hero of the poem hears of hrothgars sorrow and 
resolves to go to his assistance 

greatest of nightwoes so higelacs liegeman 
good amid geatmen of grendels achievements 
heard in his home of heroes then living 
he was stoutest and strongest sturdy and noble 
he bade them prepare him a bark that was trusty 
he said he the warking would seek oer the ocean 
the folkleader noble since he needed retainers 
for the perilous project prudent companions 
chided him little though loving him dearly 
they egged the brave atheling augured him glory 

with fourteen carefully chosen companions he sets out for daneland 

the excellent knight from the folk of the geatmen 
had liegemen selected likest to prove them 
trustworthy warriors with fourteen companions 
the vessel he looked for a liegeman then showed them 
a seacrafty man the bounds of the country 
fast the days fleeted the float was awater 
the craft by the cliff clomb to the prow then 
wellequipped warriors the wavecurrents twisted 
the sea on the sand soldiers then carried 
on the breast of the vessel brightshining jewels 
handsome wararmor heroes outshoved then 
warmen the woodship on its wishedfor adventure 



the vessel sails like a bird 

the foamynecked floater fanned by the breeze 
likest a bird glided the waters 

in twenty four hours they reach the shores of hrothgars dominions 

till twenty and four hours thereafter 
the twiststemmed vessel had traveled such distance 
that the sailingmen saw the sloping embankments 
the sea cliffs gleaming precipitous mountains 
nesses enormous they were nearing the limits 
at the end of the ocean up thence quickly 
the men of the weders clomb to the mainland 
fastened their vessel battle weeds rattled 
war burnies clattered the wielder they thanked 
that the ways oer the waters had waxen so gentle 

they are hailed by the danish coast guard 

then well from the cliff edge the guard of the scyldings 
who the seacliffs should see to saw oer the gangway 
brave ones bearing beauteous targets 
armor all ready anxiously thought he 
musing and wondering what men were approaching 
high on his horse then hrothgars retainer 
turned him to coastward mightily brandished 
his lance in his hands questioned with boldness 

his challenge 

who are ye men here mailcovered warriors 
clad in your corslets come thus adriving 
a high riding ship oer the shoals of the waters 
and hither neath helmets have hied oer the ocean 
i have been strandguard standing as warden 
lest enemies ever anywise ravage 
danish dominions with army of warships 
more boldly never have warriors ventured 
hither to come of kinsmens approval 
wordleave of warriors i ween that ye surely 

he is struck by beowulfs appearance 

nothing have known never a greater one 
of earls oer the earth have i had a sight of 
than is one of your number a hero in armor 
no lowranking fellow adorned with his weapons 
but launching them little unless looks are deceiving 
and striking appearance ere ye pass on your journey 
as treacherous spies to the land of the scyldings 
and farther fare i fully must know now 
what race ye belong to ye faraway dwellers 
seafaring sailors my simple opinion 
hear ye and hearken haste is most fitting 
plainly to tell me what place ye are come from 

from hm is much disputed one rendering is beowulf 
being away from home heard of hrothgars troubles etc another 
that adopted by s and endorsed in the hso notes is b heard 
from his neighborhood neighbors ie in his home etc a third 
is b being at home heard this as occurring away from home the 
hso glossary and notes conflict 

eoletes is marked with a by hso our rendering 
simply follows his conjectureother conjectures as to eolet are 
voyage toil labor hasty journey 

the lacuna of the ms at this point has been supplied by various 
conjectures the reading adopted by hso has been rendered in the 
above translation w like hso makes ic the beginning of a new 
sentence but for helmas bron he reads hringed stefnan this 
has the advantage of giving a parallel to brontne ceol instead of a 
kenning for gob puts the after holmas and begins a new 
sentence at the middle of the line translate what warriors are ye 
clad in armor who have thus come bringing the foaming vessel over the 
water way hither over the seas for some time on the wall i have been 
coast guard etc s endorses most of what b says but leaves out

beowulf courteously replies 

the chief of the strangers rendered him answer 
wartroopers leader and wordtreasure opened 

we are geats 

we are sprung from the lineage of the people of geatland 
and higelacs hearthfriends to heroes unnumbered 

my father ecgtheow was wellknown in his day 

my father was known a noble headwarrior 
ecgtheow titled many a winter 
he lived with the people ere he passed on his journey 
old from his dwelling each of the counsellors 
widely mid worldfolk well remembers him 

our intentions towards king hrothgar are of the kindest 

we kindly of spirit the lord of thy people 
the son of king healfdene have come here to visit 
folktroops defender be free in thy counsels 
to the noble one bear we a weighty commission 
the helm of the danemen we shall hide i ween 

is it true that a monster is slaying danish heroes 

naught of our message thou knowst if it happen 
as we soothly heard say that some savage despoiler 
some hidden pursuer on nights that are murky 
by deeds very direful mid the danemen exhibits 
hatred unheard of horrid destruction 
and the falling of dead from feelings least selfish 

i can help your king to free himself from this horrible creature 

i am able to render counsel to hrothgar 
how he wise and worthy may worst the destroyer 
if the anguish of sorrow should ever be lessened 
comfort come to him and carewaves grow cooler 
or ever hereafter he agony suffer 
and troublous distress while towereth upward 
the handsomest of houses high on the summit 

the coastguard reminds beowulf that it is easier to say than to do 

bestriding his stallion the strandwatchman answered 
the doughty retainer the difference surely 
twixt words and works the warlike shieldbearer 
who judgeth wisely well shall determine 
this band i hear beareth no malice 

i am satisfied of your good intentions and shall lead you to the 
palace 

to the prince of the scyldings pass ye then onward 
with weapons and armor i shall lead you in person 
to my wartrusty vassals command i shall issue 
to keep from all injury your excellent vessel 

your boat shall be well cared for during your stay here 

your freshtarred craft gainst every opposer 
close by the seashore till the curvedneckd bark shall 
waft back again the wellbeloved hero 
oer the way of the water to weder dominions 

he again compliments beowulf 

to warrior so great twill be granted sure 
in the storm of strife to stand secure 
onward they fared then the vessel lay quiet 
the broadbosomed bark was bound by its cable 
firmly at anchor the boarsigns glistened 
bright on the visors vivid with gilding

the heroes hastened hurried the liegemen 

the land is perhaps rolling 

descended together till they saw the great palace 
the wellfashioned wassailhall wondrous and gleaming 

heorot flashes on their view 

mid worldfolk and kindreds that was widest reputed 
of halls under heaven which the hero abode in 
its lustre enlightened lands without number 
then the battlebrave hero showed them the glittering 
court of the bold ones that they easily thither 
might fare on their journey the aforementioned warrior 
turning his courser quoth as he left them 

the coastguard having discharged his duty bids them godspeed 

tis time i were faring father almighty 
grant you his grace and give you to journey 
safe on your mission to the sea i will get me 
gainst hostile warriors as warden to stand

beowulf introduces himself at the palace 


the highway glistened with manyhued pebble 
a bypath led the liegemen together 
firm and handlocked the warburnie glistened 
the ringsword radiant rang mid the armor 
as the party was approaching the palace together 

they set their arms and armor against the wall 

in warlike equipments gainst the wall of the building 
their widefashioned warshields they weary did set then 
battleshields sturdy benchward they turned then 
their battlesarks rattled the gear of the heroes 
the lances stood up then all in a cluster 
the arms of the seamen ashenshafts mounted 
with edges of iron the armorclad troopers 

a danish hero asks them whence and why they are come 

were decked with weapons then a proudmooded hero 
asked of the champions questions of lineage 
from what borders bear ye your battleshields plated 
gilded and gleaming your graycolored burnies 
helmets with visors and heap of warlances 
to hrothgar the king i am servant and liegeman 
mong folk from farlands found i have never 

he expresses no little admiration for the strangers 

men so many of mien more courageous 
i ween that from valor nowise as outlaws 
but from greatness of soul ye sought for king hrothgar 

beowulf replies 

then the strengthfamous earlman answer rendered 
the proudmooded wederchief replied to his question 

we are higelacs tablecompanions and bear an important commission to 
your prince 

hardy neath helmet higelacs mates are we 
beowulf hight i to the bairn of healfdene 
the famous folkleader i freely will tell 
to thy prince my commission if pleasantly hearing 
hell grant we may greet him so gracious to all men 
wulfgar replied then he was prince of the wendels 
his boldness of spirit was known unto many 
his prowess and prudence the prince of the scyldings 

wulfgar the thane says that he will go and ask hrothgar whether he will 
see the strangers 

the friendlord of danemen i will ask of thy journey 
the giver of rings as thou urgest me do it 
the folkchief famous and inform thee early 
what answer the good one mindeth to render me 
he turned then hurriedly where hrothgar was sitting 
old and hoary his earlmen attending him 
the strengthfamous went till he stood at the shoulder 
of the lord of the danemen of courteous thanemen 
the custom he minded wulfgar addressed then 
his friendly liegelord folk of the geatmen 



he thereupon urges his liegelord to receive the visitors courteously 

oer the way of the waters are wafted hither 
faring from farlands the foremost in rank 
the battlechampions beowulf title 
they make this petition with thee o my chieftain 
to be granted a conference o gracious king hrothgar

hrothgar too is struck with beowulfs appearance 

in wartrappings weeded worthy they seem 
of earls to be honored sure the atheling is doughty 
who headed the heroes hitherward coming 

instead of the punctuation given by hso s proposed to insert a

hrothgar and beowulf 


hrothgar remembers beowulf as a youth and also remembers his father 

hrothgar answered helm of the scyldings 
i remember this man as the merest of striplings 
his father long dead now was ecgtheow titled 
him hrethel the geatman granted at home his 
one only daughter his battlebrave son 
is come but now sought a trustworthy friend 
seafaring sailors asserted it then 

beowulf is reported to have the strength of thirty men 

who valuable giftgems of the geatmen carried 
as peaceoffering thither that he thirty mens grapple 
has in his hand the heroinbattle 

god hath sent him to our rescue 

the holy creator usward sent him 
to westdane warriors i ween for to render 
gainst grendels grimness gracious assistance 
i shall give to the good one giftgems for courage 
hasten to bid them hither to speed them 
to see assembled this circle of kinsmen 
tell them expressly theyre welcome in sooth to 
the men of the danes to the door of the building 



wulfgar invites the strangers in 

wulfgar went then this wordmessage shouted 
my victorious liegelord bade me to tell you 
the eastdanes atheling that your origin knows he 
and oer wavebillows wafted ye welcome are hither 
valiant of spirit ye straightway may enter 
clad in corslets cased in your helmets 
to see king hrothgar here let your battleboards 
woodspears and warshafts await your conferring 
the mighty one rose then with many a liegeman 
an excellent thanegroup some there did await them 
and as bid of the brave one the battlegear guarded 
together they hied them while the hero did guide them 
neath heorots roof the highminded went then 
sturdy neath helmet till he stood in the building 
beowulf spake his burnie did glisten 
his armor seamed over by the art of the craftsman 

beowulf salutes hrothgar and then proceeds to boast of his youthful 
achievements 

hail thou hrothgar i am higelacs kinsman 
and vassal forsooth many a wonder 
i dared as a stripling the doings of grendel 
in faroff fatherland i fully did know of 
seafarers tell us this hallbuilding standeth 
excellent edifice empty and useless 
to all the earlmen after evenlights glimmer 
neath heavens bright hues hath hidden its glory 
this my earls then urged me the most excellent of them 
carles very clever to come and assist thee 
folkleader hrothgar fully they knew of 

his fight with the nickers 

the strength of my body themselves they beheld me 
when i came from the contest when covered with gore 
foes i escaped from where five i had bound 
the giantrace wasted in the waters destroying 
the nickers by night bore numberless sorrows 
the weders avenged woes had they suffered 
enemies ravaged alone now with grendel 

he intends to fight grendel unaided 

i shall manage the matter with the monster of evil 
the giant decide it thee i would therefore 
beg of thy bounty brightdanish chieftain

not to refuse me defender of warriors 
friendlord of folks so far have i sought thee 
that i may unaided my earlmen assisting me 
this bravemooded warband purify heorot 
i have heard on inquiry the horrible creature 

since the monster uses no weapons 

from veriest rashness recks not for weapons 
i this do scorn then so be higelac gracious 
my liegelord belovd lenient of spirit 
to bear a blade or a broadfashioned target 
a shield to the onset only with handgrip 

i too shall disdain to use any 

the foe i must grapple fight for my life then 
foeman with foeman he fain must rely on 
the doom of the lord whom death layeth hold of 

should he crush me he will eat my companions as he has eaten thy 
thanes 

i ween he will wish if he win in the struggle 
to eat in the warhall earls of the geatfolk 
boldly to swallow them as of yore he did often 
the best of the hrethmen thou needest not trouble 
a headwatch to give me he will have me dripping 



in case of my defeat thou wilt not have the trouble of burying me 

and dreary with gore if death overtake me 
will bear me off bleeding biting and mouthing me 
the hermit will eat me heedless of pity 
marking the moorfens no more wilt thou need then

seafarer doughty gave sorrow to unferth 
and greatest chagrin too for granted he never 
that any man else on earth should attain to 
gain under heaven more glory than he 

did you take part in a swimmingmatch with breca 

art thou that beowulf with breca did struggle 
on the wide seacurrents at swimming contended 
where to humor your pride the ocean ye tried 

twas mere folly that actuated you both to risk your lives on the ocean 

from vainest vaunting adventured your bodies 
in care of the waters and no one was able 
nor lief nor loth one in the least to dissuade you 
your difficult voyage then ye ventured aswimming 
where your arms outstretching the streams ye did cover 
the mereways measured mixing and stirring them 
glided the ocean angry the waves were 
with the weltering of winter in the waters possession 
ye toiled for a sevennight he at swimming outdid thee 
in strength excelled thee then early at morning 
on the heathoremes shore the holmcurrents tossed him 
sought he thenceward the home of his fathers 
beloved of his liegemen the land of the brondings 
the peacecastle pleasant where a people he wielded 
had borough and jewels the pledge that he made thee 

breca outdid you entirely 

the son of beanstan hath soothly accomplished 
then i ween thou wilt find thee less fortunate issue 

much more will grendel outdo you if you vie with him in prowess 

though ever triumphant in onset of battle 
a grim grappling if grendel thou darest 
for the space of a night nearby to wait for 

beowulf retaliates 

beowulf answered offspring of ecgtheow 
my good friend unferth sure freely and wildly 

o friend unferth you are fuddled with beer and cannot talk coherently 

thou fuddled with beer of breca hast spoken 
hast told of his journey a fact i allege it 
that greater strength in the waters i had then 
ills in the ocean than any man else had 
we made agreement as the merest of striplings 
promised each other both of us then were 

we simply kept an engagement made in early life 

younkers in years that we yet would adventure 
out on the ocean it all we accomplished 
while swimming the seafloods swordblade unscabbarded 
boldly we brandished our bodies expected 
to shield from the sharks he sure was unable 

he could not excel me and i would not excel him 

to swim on the waters further than i could 
more swift on the waves nor would i from him go 
then we two companions stayed in the ocean 

after five days the currents separated us 

five nights together till the currents did part us 
the weltering waters weathers the bleakest 
and nethermost night and the northwind whistled 
fierce in our faces fell were the billows 
the mere fishes mood was mightily ruffled 
and there against foemen my firmknotted corslet 
handjointed hardy help did afford me 
my battlesark braided brilliantly gilded 

a horrible seabeast attacked me but i slew him 

lay on my bosom to the bottom then dragged me 
a hateful fiendscather seized me and held me 
grim in his grapple twas granted me nathless 
to pierce the monster with the point of my weapon 
my obedient blade battle offcarried 
the mighty merecreature by means of my handblow 

it has been plausibly suggested that s in and in 
means arrival if so translate the bracket the arrival of 
beowulf the brave seafarer was a source of great chagrin to unferth 
etc

beowulf silences unferthglee is high 


so illmeaning enemies often did cause me 
sorrow the sorest i served them in quittance 

my dear sword always served me faithfully 

with my dearlovd sword as in sooth it was fitting 
they missed the pleasure of feasting abundantly 
illdoers evil of eating my body 
of surrounding the banquet deep in the ocean 
but wounded with edges early at morning 
they were stretched ahigh on the strand of the ocean 

i put a stop to the outrages of the seamonsters 

put to sleep with the sword that seagoing travelers 
no longer thereafter were hindered from sailing 
the foamdashing currents came a light from the east 
gods beautiful beacon the billows subsided 
that well i could see the nesses projecting 

fortune helps the brave earl 

the blustering crags weird often saveth 
the undoomed hero if doughty his valor 
but me did it fortune to fell with my weapon 
nine of the nickers of nightstruggle harder 
neath dome of the heaven heard i but rarely 
nor of wight more woful in the waves of the ocean 
yet i scaped with my life the grip of the monsters 

after that escape i drifted to finland 

weary from travel then the waters bare me 
to the land of the finns the flood with the current 

i have never heard of your doing any such bold deeds 

the weltering waves not a word hath been told me 
of deeds so daring done by thee unferth 
and of swordterror none never hath breca 
at the play of the battle nor either of you two 
feat so fearless performd with weapons 
glinting and gleaming 
i utter no boasting 

you are a slayer of brothers and will suffer damnation wise as you may 
be 

though with coldblooded cruelty thou killedst thy brothers 
thy nearest of kin thou needs must in hell get 
direful damnation though doughty thy wisdom 
i tell thee in earnest offspring of ecglaf 
never had grendel such numberless horrors 
the direful demon done to thy liegelord 
harrying in heorot if thy heart were as sturdy 

had your acts been as brave as your words grendel had not ravaged your 
land so long 

thy mood as ferocious as thou dost describe them 
he hath found out fully that the fierceburning hatred 
the edgebattle eager of all of your kindred 
of the victoryscyldings need little dismay him 
oaths he exacteth not any he spares 

the monster is not afraid of the danes 

of the folk of the danemen but fighteth with pleasure 
killeth and feasteth no contest expecteth 

but he will soon learn to dread the geats 

from speardanish people but the prowess and valor 
of the earls of the geatmen early shall venture 
to give him a grapple he shall go who is able 
bravely to banquet when the brightlight of morning 

on the second day any warrior may go unmolested to the meadbanquet 

which the second day bringeth the sun in its etherrobes 
oer children of men shines from the southward 
then the grayhaired warfamed giver of treasure 

hrothgars spirits are revived 

was blithesome and joyous the brightdanish ruler 
expected assistance the peoples protector 

the old king trusts beowulf the heroes are joyful 

heard from beowulf his bold resolution 
there was laughter of heroes loud was the clatter 
the words were winsome wealhtheow advanced then 

queen wealhtheow plays the hostess 

consort of hrothgar of courtesy mindful 
golddecked saluted the men in the building 
and the freeborn woman the beaker presented 

she offers the cup to her husband first 

to the lord of the kingdom first of the eastdanes 
bade him be blithesome when beer was aflowing 
lief to his liegemen he lustily tasted 
of banquet and beaker battlefamed ruler 
the helmingish lady then graciously circled 
mid all the liegemen lesser and greater 



she gives presents to the heroes 

treasurecups tendered till time was afforded 
that the decorousmooded diademed folkqueen 

then she offers the cup to beowulf thanking god that aid has come 

might bear to beowulf the bumper oerrunning 
she greeted the geatprince god she did thank 
most wise in her words that her wish was accomplished 
that in any of earlmen she ever should look for 
solace in sorrow he accepted the beaker 
battlebold warrior at wealhtheows giving 

beowulf states to the queen the object of his visit 

then equipped for combat quoth he in measures 
beowulf spake offspring of ecgtheow 
i purposed in spirit when i mounted the ocean 

i determined to do or die 

when i boarded my boat with a band of my liegemen 
i would work to the fullest the will of your people 
or in foesclutches fastened fall in the battle 
deeds i shall do of daring and prowess 
or the last of my lifedays live in this meadhall 
these words to the lady were welcome and pleasing 
the boast of the geatman with gold trappings broidered 
went the freeborn folkqueen her fondlord to sit by 

glee is high 

then again as of yore was heard in the building 
courtly discussion conquerors shouting 
heroes were happy till healfdenes son would 
go to his slumber to seek for refreshing 
for the horrid hellmonster in the hallbuilding knew he 
a fight was determined since the light of the sun they 
no longer could see and lowering darkness 
oer all had descended and dark under heaven 
shadowy shapes came shying around them 

hrothgar retires leaving beowulf in charge of the hall 

the liegemen all rose then one saluted the other 
hrothgar beowulf in rhythmical measures 
wishing him well and the wassailhall giving 
to his care and keeping quoth he departing 
not to any one else have i ever entrusted 
but thee and thee only the hall of the danemen 
since high i could heave my hand and my buckler 
take thou in charge now the noblest of houses 
be mindful of honor exhibiting prowess 
watch gainst the foeman thou shalt want no enjoyments 
survive thou safely adventure so glorious 

the repetition of hwere and is regarded by some 
scholars as a defect b suggests sw r for the first so there 
it befell me etc another suggestion is to change the second 
hwere into sw r so there i escaped with my life etc 

kl suggests a period after determined this would give the 
passage as follows since they no longer could see the light of the 
sun and lowering darkness was down over all dire under the heavens 
shadowy beings came going around them

all sleep save one 


hrothgar retires 

then hrothgar departed his earlthrong attending him 
folklord of scyldings forth from the building 
the warchieftain wished then wealhtheow to look for 
the queen for a bedmate to keep away grendel 

god has provided a watch for the hall 

the glory of kings had given a hallwatch 
as men heard recounted for the king of the danemen 
he did special service gave the giant a watcher 
and the prince of the geatmen implicitly trusted 

beowulf is selfconfident 

his warlike strength and the wielders protection 

he prepares for rest 

his armor of iron off him he did then 
his helmet from his head to his henchman committed 
his chasedhandled chainsword choicest of weapons 
and bade him bide with his battleequipments 
the good one then uttered words of defiance 
beowulf geatman ere his bed he upmounted 

beowulf boasts of his ability to cope with grendel 

i hold me no meaner in matters of prowess 
in warlike achievements than grendel does himself 
hence i seek not with swordedge to sooth him to slumber 
of life to bereave him though well i am able 

we will fight with natures weapons only 

no battleskill has he that blows he should strike me 
to shatter my shield though sure he is mighty 
in strife and destruction but struggling by night we 
shall do without edges dare he to look for 
weaponless warfare and wisemooded father 
the glory apportion god everholy 

god may decide who shall conquer 

on which hand soever to him seemeth proper 
then the bravemooded hero bent to his slumber 
the pillow received the cheek of the noble 

the geatish warriors lie down 

and many a martial merethane attending 
sank to his slumber seemed it unlikely 

they thought it very unlikely that they should ever see their homes 
again 

that ever thereafter any should hope to 
be happy at home herofriends visit 
or the lordly troopcastle where he lived from his childhood 
they had heard how slaughter had snatched from the winehall 
had recently ravished of the race of the scyldings 

but god raised up a deliverer 

too many by far but the lord to them granted 
the weaving of warspeed to wederish heroes 
aid and comfort that every opponent 
by one mans warmight they worsted and vanquished 

god rules the world 

by the might of himself the truth is established 
that god almighty hath governed for ages 
kindreds and nations a night very lurid 

grendel comes to heorot 

the travlerattwilight came tramping and striding 
the warriors were sleeping who should watch the hornedbuilding 

only one warrior is awake 

one only excepted mid earthmen twas stablished 
th implacable foeman was powerless to hurl them 
to the land of shadows if the lord were unwilling 
but serving as warder in terror to foemen 
he angrily bided the issue of battle 

gr understood gdra as meaning advantages in battle this 
rendering hso rejects the latter takes the passage as meaning that 
grendel though mighty and formidable has no skill in the art of war 

b in his masterly articles on beowulf p and b xii rejects 
the division usually made at this point usually rendered 
then he translates when and connects its clause with the 
foregoing sentence these changes he makes to reduce the number of 
cms as principal verbs cf with all deference to 
this acute scholar i must say that it seems to me that the poet is 
exhausting his resources to bring out clearly the supreme event on 
which the whole subsequent action turns first he grendel came in 
the wan night second he came from the moor third he came to 
the hall time place from which place to which are all given 






xii 

grendel and beowulf 


grendel comes from the fens 

neath the cloudy cliffs came from the moor then 
grendel going gods anger bare he 
the monster intended some one of earthmen 
in the hallbuilding grand to entrap and make way with 

he goes towards the joyous building 

he went under welkin where well he knew of 
the winejoyous building brilliant with plating 
goldhall of earthmen not the earliest occasion 

this was not his first visit there 

he the home and manor of hrothgar had sought 
neer found he in lifedays later nor earlier 
hardier hero hallthanes more sturdy 
then came to the building the warrior marching 

his horrid fingers tear the door open 

bereft of his joyance the door quickly opened 
on firehinges fastened when his fingers had touched it 
the fell one had flung thenhis fury so bitter 
open the entrance early thereafter 
the foeman trod the shining hallpavement 

he strides furiously into the hall 

strode he angrily from the eyes of him glimmered 
a lustre unlovely likest to fire 
he beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers 
a circle of kinsmen sleeping together 

he exults over his supposed prey 

a throng of thanemen then his thoughts were exultant 
he minded to sunder from each of the thanemen 
the life from his body horrible demon 
ere morning came since fate had allowed him 

fate has decreed that he shall devour no more heroes beowulf suffers 
from suspense 

the prospect of plenty providence willed not 
to permit him any more of men under heaven 
to eat in the nighttime higelacs kinsman 
great sorrow endured how the diremooded creature 
in unlookedfor assaults were likely to bear him 
no thought had the monster of deferring the matter 

grendel immediately seizes a sleeping warrior and devours him 

but on earliest occasion he quickly laid hold of 
a soldier asleep suddenly tore him 
bit his boneprison the blood drank in currents 
swallowed in mouthfuls he soon had the dead mans 
feet and hands too eaten entirely 
nearer he strode then the stouthearted warrior 

beowulf and grendel grapple 

snatched as he slumbered seizing with handgrip 
forward the foeman foined with his hand 
caught he quickly the cunning deviser 
on his elbow he rested this early discovered 
the master of malice that in middleearths regions 
neath the whole of the heavens no handgrapple greater 

the monster is amazed at beowulfs strength 

in any man else had he ever encountered 
fearful in spirit faintmooded waxed he 
not off could betake him death he was pondering 

he is anxious to flee 

would fly to his covert seek the devils assembly 
his calling no more was the same he had followed 
long in his lifetime the liegekinsman worthy 

beowulf recalls his boast of the evening and determines to fulfil it 

of higelac minded his speech of the evening 
stood he up straight and stoutly did seize him 
his fingers crackled the giant was outward 
the earl stepped farther the famous one minded 
to flee away farther if he found an occasion 
and off and away avoiding delay 
to fly to the fenmoors he fully was ware of 
the strength of his grapple in the grip of the foeman 

twas a luckless day for grendel 

twas an illtaken journey that the injurybringing 
harrying harmer to heorot wandered 

the hall groans 

the palace reechoed to all of the danemen 
dwellers in castles to each of the bold ones 
earlmen was terror angry they both were 
archwarders raging rattled the building 
twas a marvellous wonder that the winehall withstood then 
the boldinbattle bent not to earthward 
excellent earthhall but within and without it 
was fastened so firmly in fetters of iron 
by the art of the armorer off from the sill there 
bent meadbenches many as men have informed me 
adorned with goldwork where the grim ones did struggle 
the scylding wise men weened neer before 
that by might and mainstrength a man under heaven 
might break it in pieces bonedecked resplendent 
crush it by cunning unless clutch of the fire 
in smoke should consume it the sound mounted upward 

grendels cries terrify the danes 

novel enough on the north danes fastened 
a terror of anguish on all of the men there 
who heard from the wall the weeping and plaining 
the song of defeat from the foeman of heaven 
heard him hymns of horror howl and his sorrow 
hellbound bewailing he held him too firmly 
who was strongest of mainstrength of men of that era 

b and tb emend so as to make lines and read never in his 
life earlier or later had he the hellthane found a braver 
herothey argue that beowulfs companions had done nothing to merit 
such encomiums as the usual readings allow them 

for re rnweardas tb suggests re rnhearde 
translate they were both angry raging and mighty 




xiii 

grendel is vanquished 


beowulf has no idea of letting grendel live 

for no cause whatever would the earlmens defender 
leave in lifejoys the loathsome newcomer 
he deemed his existence utterly useless 
to men under heaven many a noble 
of beowulf brandished his battlesword old 
would guard the life of his lord and protector 
the farfamous chieftain if able to do so 
while waging the warfare this wist they but little 
brave battlethanes while his body intending 

no weapon would harm grendel he bore a charmed life 

to slit into slivers and seeking his spirit 
that the relentless foeman nor finest of weapons 
of all on the earth nor any of warbills 
was willing to injure but weapons of victory 
swords and suchlike he had sworn to dispense with 
his death at that time must prove to be wretched 
and the faraway spirit widely should journey 
into enemies power this plainly he saw then 
who with mirth of mood malice no little 
had wrought in the past on the race of the earthmen 
to god he was hostile that his body would fail him 
but higelacs hardy henchman and kinsman 
held him by the hand hateful to other 

grendel is sorely wounded 

was each one if living a bodywound suffered 
the direful demon damage incurable 

his body bursts 

was seen on his shoulder his sinews were shivered 
his body did burst to beowulf was given 
glory in battle grendel from thenceward 
must flee and hide him in the fencliffs and marshes 
sick unto death his dwelling must look for 
unwinsome and woful he wist the more fully 

the monster flees away to hide in the moors 

the end of his earthly existence was nearing 
his lifedays limits at last for the danemen 
when the slaughter was over their wish was accomplished 
the comerfromfarland had cleansed then of evil 
wise and valiant the warhall of hrothgar 
saved it from violence he joyed in the nightwork 
in repute for prowess the prince of the geatmen 
for the eastdanish people his boast had accomplished 
bettered their burdensome balesorrows fully 
the craftbegot evil they erstwhile had suffered 
and were forced to endure from crushing oppression 
their manifold misery twas a manifest token 

beowulf suspends grendels hand and arm in heorot 

when the heroinbattle the hand suspended 
the arm and the shoulder there was all of the claw 
of grendel together neath greatstretching hallroof 

it has been proposed to translate myre by with sorrow but 
there seems no authority for such a rendering to the present 
translator the phrase mdes myre seems a mere padding for 
gladly ie he who gladly harassed mankind 






xiv 

rejoicing of the danes 


at early dawn warriors from far and near come together to hear of the 
nights adventures 

in the mist of the morning many a warrior 
stood round the gifthall as the story is told me 
folkprinces fared then from far and from near 
through longstretching journeys to look at the wonder 
the footprints of the foeman few of the warriors 

few warriors lamented grendels destruction 

who gazed on the foottracks of the inglorious creature 
his parting from life pained very deeply 
how weary in spirit off from those regions 
in combats conquered he carried his traces 
fated and flying to the flood of the nickers 

grendels blood dyes the waters 

there in bloody billows bubbled the currents 
the angry eddy was everywhere mingled 
and seething with gore welling with swordblood 
he deathdoomed had hid him when reaved of his joyance 
he laid down his life in the lair he had fled to 
his heathenish spirit where hell did receive him 
thence the friends from of old backward turned them 
and many a younker from merry adventure 
striding their stallions stout from the seaward 
heroes on horses there were heard very often 

beowulf is the hero of the hour 

beowulfs praises many often asserted 
that neither south nor north in the circuit of waters 

he is regarded as a probable successor to hrothgar 

oer outstretching earthplain none other was better 
mid bearers of warshields more worthy to govern 
neath the arch of the ether not any however 
gainst the friendlord muttered mockingwords uttered 

but no word is uttered to derogate from the old king 

of hrothgar the gracious a good king he 
oft the famed ones permitted their fallowskinned horses 
to run in rivalry racing and chasing 
where the fieldways appeared to them fair and inviting 
known for their excellence oft a thane of the folklord 

the gleeman sings the deeds of heroes 

a man of celebrity mindful of rhythms 
who ancient traditions treasured in memory 
new wordgroups found properly bound 
the bard after gan then beowulfs venture 

he sings in alliterative measures of beowulfs prowess 

wisely to tell of and words that were clever 
to utter skilfully earnestly speaking 
everything told he that he heard as to sigmunds 

also of sigemund who has slain a great firedragon 

mighty achievements many things hidden 
the strife of the wlsing the widegoing ventures 
the children of men knew of but little 
the feud and the fury but fitela with him 
when suchlike matters he minded to speak of 
uncle to nephew as in every contention 
each to other was ever devoted 
a numerous host of the race of the scathers 
they had slain with the swordedge to sigmund accrued then 
no little of glory when his lifedays were over 
since he sturdy in struggle had destroyed the great dragon 
the hoardtreasures keeper neath the hoargrayish stone he 
the son of the atheling unaided adventured 
the perilous project not present was fitela 
yet the fortune befell him of forcing his weapon 
through the marvellous dragon that it stood in the wall 
wellhonored weapon the worm was slaughtered 
the great one had gained then by his glorious achievement 
to reap from the ringhoard richest enjoyment 
as best it did please him his vessel he loaded 
shining ornaments on the ships bosom carried 
kinsman of wls the drake in heat melted 

sigemund was widely famed 

he was farthest famed of fugitive pilgrims 
mid widescattered worldfolk for works of great prowess 
wartroopers shelter hence waxed he in honor 

heremod an unfortunate danish king is introduced by way of contrast 

afterward heremods herostrength failed him 
his vigor and valor mid venomous haters 
to the hands of foemen he was foully delivered 
offdriven early agonybillows 

unlike sigemund and beowulf heremod was a burden to his people 

oppressed him too long to his people he became then 
to all the athelings an evergreat burden 
and the daring ones journey in days of yore 
many wise men were wont to deplore 
such as hoped he would bring them help in their sorrow 
that the son of their ruler should rise into power 
holding the headship held by his fathers 
should govern the people the goldhoard and borough 
the kingdom of heroes the realm of the scyldings 

beowulf is an honor to his race 

he to all men became then far more beloved 
higelacs kinsman to kindreds and races 
to his friends much dearer him malice assaulted 

the story is resumed 

oft running and racing on roadsters they measured 
the duncolored highways then the light of the morning 
was hurried and hastened went henchmen in numbers 
to the beautiful building bold ones in spirit 
to look at the wonder the liegelord himself then 
from his wifebower wending warden of treasures 
glorious trod with troopers unnumbered 
famed for his virtues and with him the queenwife

hrothgars gratitude 


hrothgar discoursed to the hallbuilding went he 
he stood by the pillar saw the steeprising hallroof 
gleaming with goldgems and grendel his hand there 

hrothgar gives thanks for the overthrow of the monster 

for the sight we behold now thanks to the wielder 
early be offered much evil i bided 
snaring from grendel god can eer complish 
wonder on wonder wielder of glory 

i had given up all hope when this brave liegeman came to our aid 

but lately i reckoned neer under heaven 
comfort to gain me for any of sorrows 
while the handsomest of houses horrid with bloodstain 
gory uptowered grief had offfrightened 
each of the wise ones who weened not that ever 
the folktroops defences gainst foes they should strengthen 
gainst sprites and monsters through the might of the wielder 
a doughty retainer hath a deed now accomplished 
which erstwhile we all with our excellent wisdom 

if his mother yet liveth well may she thank god for this son 

failed to perform may affirm very truly 
what woman soever in all of the nations 
gave birth to the child if yet she surviveth 
that the longruling lord was lavish to herward 
in the birth of the bairn now beowulf dear 

hereafter beowulf thou shalt be my son 

most excellent hero ill love thee in spirit 
as bairn of my body bear well henceforward 
the relationship new no lack shall befall thee 
of earthjoys any i ever can give thee 
full often for lesser service ive given 
hero less hardy hoardtreasure precious 

thou hast won immortal distinction 

to a weaker in warstrife by works of distinction 
thou hast gained for thyself now that thy glory shall flourish 
forever and ever the allruler quite thee 
with good from his hand as he hitherto did thee 

beowulf replies i was most happy to render thee this service 

beowulf answered ecgtheows offspring 
that labor of glory most gladly achieved we 
the combat accomplished unquailing we ventured 
the enemys grapple i would grant it much rather 
thou wert able to look at the creature in person 
faint unto falling the foe in his trappings 
on murderbed quickly i minded to bind him 
with firmholding fetters that forced by my grapple 
low he should lie in lifeanddeath struggle 
less his body escape i was wholly unable 

i could not keep the monster from escaping as god did not will that i 
should 

since god did not will it to keep him from going 
not held him that firmly hated opposer 
too swift was the foeman yet safety regarding 
he suffered his hand behind him to linger 
his arm and shoulder to act as watcher 

he left his hand and arm behind 

no shadow of solace the woebegone creature 
found him there nathless the hated destroyer 
liveth no longer lashed for his evils 
but sorrow hath seized him in snaremeshes hath him 
close in its clutches keepeth him writhing 
in baleful bonds there banished for evil 
the man shall wait for the mighty tribunal 

god will give him his deserts 

how the god of glory shall give him his earnings 
then the soldier kept silent son of old ecglaf 

unferth has nothing more to say for beowulfs actions speak louder than 
words 

from boasting and bragging of battleachievements 
since the princes beheld there the hand that depended 
neath the lofty halltimbers by the might of the nobleman 
each one before him the enemys fingers 
each fingernail strong steel most resembled 
the heathen ones handspur the heroinbattles 
claw most uncanny quoth they agreeing 



no sword will harm the monster 

that not any excellent edges of brave ones 
was willing to touch him the terrible creatures

hrothgar goes to the banquet 

when feasting is finished full was the time then 
that the son of healfdene went to the building 
the excellent atheling would eat of the banquet 
neer heard i that people with heroband larger 
bare them better towrds their braceletbestower 
the ladenwithglory stooped to the bench then 
their kinsmencompanions in plenty were joyful 
many a cupful quaffing complaisantly 
doughty of spirit in the hightowring palace 

hrothgars nephew hrothulf is present 

hrothgar and hrothulf heorot then inside 
was filled with friendly ones falsehood and treachery 
the folkscyldings now nowise did practise 

hrothgar lavishes gifts upon beowulf 

then the offspring of healfdene offered to beowulf 
a golden standard as reward for the victory 
a banner embossed burnie and helmet 
many men saw then a songfamous weapon 
borne fore the hero beowulf drank of 
the cup in the building that treasurebestowing 
he needed not blush for in battlemens presence 

four handsomer gifts were never presented 

neer heard i that many men on the alebench 
in friendlier fashion to their fellows presented 
four bright jewels with goldwork embellished 
round the roof of the helmet a headguarder outside 
braided with wires with bosses was furnished 
that swordsforthebattle fighthardened might fail 
boldly to harm him when the hero proceeded 

hrothgar commands that eight finely caparisoned steeds be brought to 
beowulf 

forth against foemen the defender of earls then 
commanded that eight steeds with bridles 
goldplated gleaming be guided to hallward 
inside the building on one of them stood then 
an artbroidered saddle embellished with jewels 
twas the sovereigns seat when the son of king healfdene 
was pleased to take part in the play of the edges 
the famous ones valor neer failed at the front when 
slain ones were bowing and to beowulf granted 
the prince of the ingwins power over both 
oer warsteeds and weapons bade him well to enjoy them 
in so manly a manner the mightyfamed chieftain

instead of gefrtwod and renders then was it commanded to adorn 
heorot within quickly with handsthe former has the advantage of 
affording a parallel to gefrtwod both have the disadvantage of 
altering the text 

the passage seems to be hopeless one difficult point is

banquet continuedthe scops song of finn and hnf 


each of beowulfs companions receives a costly gift 

and the atheling of earlmen to each of the heroes 
who the ways of the waters went with beowulf 
a costly gifttoken gave on the meadbench 
offered an heirloom and ordered that that man 

the warrior killed by grendel is to be paid for in gold 

with gold should be paid for whom grendel had erstwhile 
wickedly slaughtered as he more of them had done 
had farseeing god and the mood of the hero 
the fate not averted the father then governed 
all of the earthdwellers as he ever is doing 
hence insight for all men is everywhere fittest 
forethought of spirit much he shall suffer 
of lief and of loathsome who long in this present 
useth the world in this woful existence 
there was music and merriment mingling together 

hrothgars scop recalls events in the reign of his lords father 

touching healfdenes leader the joywood was fingered 
measures recited when the singer of hrothgar 
on meadbench should mention the merry halljoyance 
of the kinsmen of finn when onset surprised them 

hnf the danish general is treacherously attacked while staying at 
finns castle 

the halfdanish hero hnf of the scyldings 
on the field of the frisians was fated to perish 
sure hildeburg needed not mention approving 
the faith of the jutemen though blameless entirely 

queen hildeburg is not only wife of finn but a kinswoman of the murdered 
hnf 

when shields were shivered she was shorn of her darlings 
of bairns and brothers they bent to their fate 
with warspear wounded woe was that woman 
not causeless lamented the daughter of hoce 
the decree of the wielder when morninglight came and 
she was able neath heaven to behold the destruction 
of brothers and bairns where the brightest of earthjoys 

finns force is almost exterminated 

she had hitherto had all the henchmen of finn 
war had offtaken save a handful remaining 
that he nowise was able to offer resistance 

hengest succeeds hnf as danish general 

to the onset of hengest in the parley of battle 
nor the wretched remnant to rescue in war from 
the earl of the atheling but they offered conditions 

compact between the frisians and the danes 

another great building to fully make ready 
a hall and a highseat that half they might rule with 
the sons of the jutemen and that folcwaldas son would 
day after day the danemen honor 
when gifts were giving and grant of his ringstore 
to hengests earltroop ever so freely 
of his goldplated jewels as he encouraged the frisians 

equality of gifts agreed on 

on the bench of the beerhall on both sides they swore then 
a fastbinding compact finn unto hengest 
with no thought of revoking vowed then most solemnly 
the woebegone remnant well to take charge of 
his witan advising the agreement should no one 
by words or works weaken and shatter 
by artifice ever injure its value 
though reaved of their ruler their ringgivers slayer 
they followed as vassals fate so requiring 

no one shall refer to old grudges 

then if one of the frisians the quarrel should speak of 
in tones that were taunting terrible edges 
should cut in requital accomplished the oath was 
and treasure of gold from the hoard was uplifted 

danish warriors are burned on a funeralpyre 

the best of the scylding braves was then fully 
prepared for the pile at the pyre was seen clearly

the finn episode continuedthe banquet continues 


the survivors go to friesland the home of finn 

then the warriors departed to go to their dwellings 
reaved of their friends friesland to visit 
their homes and highcity hengest continued 

hengest remains there all winter unable to get away 

biding with finn the bloodtainted winter 
wholly unsundered of fatherland thought he 
though unable to drive the ringstemmd vessel 
oer the ways of the waters the wavedeeps were tossing 
fought with the wind winter in icebonds 
closed up the currents till there came to the dwelling 
a year in its course as yet it revolveth 
if season propitious one alway regardeth 
worldcheering weathers then winter was gone 
earths bosom was lovely the exile would get him 

he devises schemes of vengeance 

the guest from the palace on grewsomest vengeance 
he brooded more eager than on oversea journeys 
wher onsetofanger he were able to complish 
the bairns of the jutemen therein to remember 
nowise refused he the duties of liegeman 
when hun of the frisians the battlesword lfing 
fairest of falchions friendly did give him 
its edges were famous in folktalk of jutland 
and savage swordfury seized in its clutches 
boldmooded finn where he bode in his palace 

guthlaf and oslaf revenge hnfs slaughter 

when the grewsome grapple guthlaf and oslaf 
had mournfully mentioned the merejourney over 
for sorrows halfblamed him the flickering spirit 
could not bide in his bosom then the building was covered 

finn is slain 

with corpses of foemen and finn too was slaughtered 
the king with his comrades and the queen made a prisoner 

the jewels of finn and his queen are carried away by the danes 

the troops of the scyldings bore to their vessels 
all that the landking had in his palace 
such trinkets and treasures they took as on searching 
at finns they could find they ferried to daneland 
the excellent woman on oversea journey 

the lay is concluded and the main story is resumed 

led her to their landfolk the lay was concluded 
the gleemans recital shouts again rose then 
benchglee resounded bearers then offered 

skinkers carry round the beaker 

wine from wondervats wealhtheo advanced then 
going neath goldcrown where the good ones were seated 



queen wealhtheow greets hrothgar as he sits beside hrothulf his 
nephew 

uncle and nephew their peace was yet mutual 
true each to the other and unferth the spokesman 
sat at the feet of the lord of the scyldings 
each trusted his spirit that his mood was courageous 
though at fight he had failed in faith to his kinsmen 
said the queen of the scyldings my lord and protector 
treasurebestower take thou this beaker 
joyance attend thee goldfriend of heroes 

be generous to the geats 

and greet thou the geatmen with gracious responses 
so ought one to do be kind to the geatmen 
in gifts not niggardly anear and afar now 
peace thou enjoyest report hath informed me 
thoult have for a bairn the battlebrave hero 
now is heorot cleansd ringpalace gleaming 

have as much joy as possible in thy hall once more purified 

give while thou mayest many rewards 
and bequeath to thy kinsmen kingdom and people 
on wending thy way to the wielders splendor 
i know good hrothulf that the noble young troopers 

i know that hrothulf will prove faithful if he survive thee 

hell care for and honor lord of the scyldings 
if earthjoys thou endest earlier than he doth 
i reckon that recompense hell render with kindness 
our offspring and issue if that all he remember 
what favors of yore when he yet was an infant 
we awarded to him for his worship and pleasure 
then she turned by the bench where her sons were carousing 
hrethric and hrothmund and the heroes offspring 

beowulf is sitting by the two royal sons 

the waryouth together there the good one was sitting 
twixt the brothers twain beowulf geatman 

for r and gr suggest elne unflitme as reads 
the latter verse is undisputed and for the former elne would be 
as possible as ealles and unflitme is well supported accepting 
elne unflitme for both i would suggest very peaceably for both 
places finn to hengest very peaceably vowed with oaths etc 
hengest then still the slaughterstained winter remained there 
with finn very peaceably the two passages become thus correlatives 
the second a sequel of the first elne in the sense of very 
swe needs no argument and unflitme from fltan can it 
seems to me be more plausibly rendered peaceful peaceable than 
contestable or conquerable 

some scholars have proposed roden the line would then read 
then the building was reddened etc instead of covered the h 
may have been carried over from the three alliterating hs

beowulf receives further honor 


more gifts are offered beowulf 

a beaker was borne him and bidding to quaff it 
graciously given and gold that was twisted 
pleasantly proffered a pair of armjewels 
rings and corslet of collars the greatest 
ive heard of neath heaven of heroes not any 
more splendid from jewels have i heard neath the welkin 

a famous necklace is referred to in comparison with the gems presented 
to beowulf

reading than one joining in such intimate syntactical relations

combat i cannot see gearwe occurs quite frequently with on cf 
b ready for the pyre el ready for the glad

they lay aside on retiring and he closes his narration by saying that

the mother of grendel 


they sank then to slumber with sorrow one paid for 
his evening repose as often betid them 
while grendel was holding the goldbedecked palace 
illdeeds performing till his end overtook him 
death for his sins twas seen very clearly 

grendels mother is known to be thirsting for revenge 

known unto earthfolk that still an avenger 
outlived the loathed one long since the sorrow 
caused by the struggle the mother of grendel 
devilshaped woman her woe ever minded 
who was held to inhabit the horrible waters 

grendels progenitor cain is again referred to 

the coldflowing currents after cain had become a 
slayerwithedges to his one only brother 
the son of his sire he set out then banished 
marked as a murderer manjoys avoiding 
lived in the desert thence demons unnumbered 

the poet again magnifies beowulfs valor 

fatesent awoke one of them grendel 
swordcursd hateful who at heorot met with 
a man that was watching waiting the struggle 
where a horrid one held him with handgrapple sturdy 
nathless he minded the might of his body 
the glorious gift god had allowed him 
and folkruling fathers favor relied on 
his help and his comfort so he conquered the foeman 
the hellspirit humbled he unhappy departed then 
reaved of his joyance journeying to deathhaunts 
foeman of man his mother moreover 

grendels mother comes to avenge her son 

eager and gloomy was anxious to go on 
her mournful mission mindful of vengeance 
for the death of her son she came then to heorot 
where the armordane earlmen all through the building 
were lying in slumber soon there became then 
return to the nobles when the mother of grendel 
entered the folkhall the fear was less grievous 
by even so much as the vigor of maidens 
warstrength of women by warrior is reckoned 
when wellcarved weapon worked with the hammer 
blade very bloody brave with its edges 
strikes down the boarsign that stands on the helmet 
then the hardedgd weapon was heaved in the building 
the brand oer the benches broadlindens many 
handfast were lifted for helmet he recked not 
for armornet broad whom terror laid hold of 
she went then hastily outward would get her 
her life for to save when some one did spy her 

she seizes a favorite liegemen of hrothgars 

soon she had grappled one of the athelings 
fast and firmly when fenward she hied her 
that one to hrothgar was liefest of heroes 
in rank of retainer where waters encircle 
a mighty shieldwarrior whom she murdered at slumber 
a broadlyfamed battleknight beowulf was absent 

beowulf was asleep in another part of the palace 

but another apartment was erstwhile devoted 
to the glorydecked geatman when gold was distributed 
there was hubbub in heorot the hand that was famous 
she grasped in its gore grief was renewed then 
in homes and houses twas no happy arrangement 
in both of the quarters to barter and purchase 
with lives of their friends then the wellagd ruler 
the grayheaded warthane was woful in spirit 
when his longtrusted liegeman lifeless he knew of 

beowulf is sent for 

his dearest one gone quick from a room was 
beowulf brought brave and triumphant 
as day was dawning in the dusk of the morning 

he comes at hrothgars summons 

went then that earlman champion noble 
came with comrades where the clever one bided 
whether god all gracious would grant him a respite 
after the woe he had suffered the warworthy hero 
with a troop of retainers trod then the pavement 
the hallbuilding groaned till he greeted the wise one 

beowulf inquires how hrothgar had enjoyed his nights rest 

the earl of the ingwins asked if the night had 
fully refreshed him as fain he would have it 

several eminent authorities either read or emend the ms so as to 
make this verse read while grendel was wasting the goldbedecked 
palace so below ravaged the desert 

for sna tb suggests sra limiting edhwyrft read

the syntactical gap after edhwyrft 

some authorities follow greins lexicon in treating heard ecg as

each of us must the endday abide of 
his earthly existence who is able accomplish 
glory ere death to battlethane noble

of each of thy sorrows as i hope for thee soothly

came on the cliff the current was seething 
with blood and with gore the troopers gazed on it

sunder from earthjoys with arrow from bowstring 
from his seastruggle tore him that the trusty warmissile 

the dead beast is a poor swimmer 

pierced to his vitals he proved in the currents 
less doughty at swimming whom death had offcarried 
soon in the waters the wonderful swimmer 
was straitened most sorely with swordpointed boarspears 
pressed in the battle and pulled to the cliffedge 
the liegemen then looked on the loathfashioned stranger 

beowulf prepares for a struggle with the monster 

beowulf donned then his battleequipments 
cared little for life inlaid and most ample 
the handwoven corslet which could cover his body 
must the wavedeeps explore that war might be powerless 
to harm the great hero and the hating ones grasp might 
not peril his safety his head was protected 
by the lightflashing helmet that should mix with the bottoms 
trying the eddies treasureemblazoned 
encircled with jewels as in seasons long past 
the weaponsmith worked it wondrously made it 
with swinebodies fashioned it that thenceforward no longer

and that was not least of helpers in prowess 

he has unferths sword in his hand 

that hrothgars spokesman had lent him when straitened 
and the hilted handsword was hrunting entitled 
old and most excellent mong all of the treasures 
its blade was of iron blotted with poison 
hardened with gore it failed not in battle 
any hero under heaven in hand who it brandished 
who ventured to take the terrible journeys

drunken with wine when the weapon he lent to

good overmeasure enjoyed him while able 
and the ancient heirloom unferth permit thou

beowulf is doubleconqueror 


beowulf grasps a giantsword 

then he saw mid the wargems a weapon of victory 
an ancient giantsword of edges adoughty 
glory of warriors of weapons twas choicest 
only twas larger than any man else was 
able to bear to the battleencounter 
the good and splendid work of the giants 
he grasped then the swordhilt knight of the scyldings 
bold and battlegrim brandished his ringsword 
hopeless of living hotly he smote her 
that the fiendwomans neck firmly it grappled 

and fells the female monster 

broke through her bonejoints the bill fully pierced her 
fatecursd body she fell to the ground then 
the handsword was bloody the hero exulted 
the brand was brilliant brightly it glimmered 
just as from heaven gemlike shineth 
the torch of the firmament he glanced long the building 
and turned by the wall then higelacs vassal 
raging and wrathful raised his battlesword 
strong by the handle the edge was not useless 
to the heroinbattle but he speedily wished to 
give grendel requital for the many assaults he 
had worked on the westdanes not once but often 
when he slew in slumber the subjects of hrothgar 
swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers 
of the folk of the danemen and fully as many 
carried away a horrible prey 
he gave him requital grimraging champion 

beowulf sees the body of grendel and cuts off his head 

when he saw on his restplace weary of conflict 
grendel lying of lifejoys bereavd 
as the battle at heorot erstwhile had scathed him 
his body far bounded a blow when he suffered 
death having seized him swordsmiting heavy 
and he cut off his head then early this noticed 
the clever carles who as comrades of hrothgar 

the waters are gory 

gazed on the seadeeps that the surging wavecurrents 
were mightily mingled the mereflood was gory 
of the good one the grayhaired together held converse 

beowulf is given up for dead 

the hoary of head that they hoped not to see again 
the atheling ever that exulting in victory 
hed return there to visit the distinguished folkruler 
then many concluded the merewolf had killed him 
the ninth hour came then from the nessedge departed 
the boldmooded scyldings the goldfriend of heroes 
homeward betook him the strangers sat down then 
soulsick sorrowful the seawaves regarding 
they wished and yet weened not their wellloved friendlord 

the giantsword melts 

to see any more the swordblade began then 
the blood having touched it contracting and shriveling 
with battleicicles twas a wonderful marvel 
that it melted entirely likest to ice when 
the father unbindeth the bond of the frost and 
unwindeth the wavebands he who wieldeth dominion 
of times and of tides a truthfirm creator 
nor took he of jewels more in the dwelling 
lord of the weders though they lay all around him 
than the head and the handle handsome with jewels 
the brand early melted burnt was the weapon 
so hot was the blood the strangespirit poisonous 

the hero swims back to the realms of day 

that in it did perish he early swam off then 
who had bided in combat the carnage of haters 
went up through the ocean the eddies were cleansd 
the spacious expanses when the spirit from farland 
his life put aside and this shortlived existence 
the seamens defender came swimming to land then 
doughty of spirit rejoiced in his seagift 
the bulky burden which he bore in his keeping 
the excellent vassals advanced then to meet him 
to god they were grateful were glad in their chieftain 
that to see him safe and sound was granted them 
from the highminded hero then helmet and burnie 
were speedily loosened the ocean was putrid 
the water neath welkin weltered with gore 
forth did they fare then their footsteps retracing 
merry and mirthful measured the earthway 
the highway familiar men very daring 
bare then the head from the seacliff burdening 
each of the earlmen excellentvaliant 

it takes four men to carry grendels head on a spear 

four of them had to carry with labor 
the head of grendel to the high towering goldhall 
upstuck on the spear till fourteen mostvaliant

straight to the palace the prince of the people 
measured the meadways their moodbrave companion 
the atheling of earlmen entered the building

then hung by the hair the head of grendel 
was borne to the building where beerthanes were drinking 
loth before earlmen and eke fore the lady

s monige gewear and hafa s geworden in a 
paper published some years ago in one of the johns hopkins university 
circulars i tried to throw upon these two longdoubtful passages some 
light derived from a study of like passages in alfreds prosethe 
impersonal verb geweoran with an accus of the person and a 
tclause is used several times with the meaning agree see orosius 
sweets ed in the two 
beowulf passages the tclause is anticipated by s which is 
clearly a gen of the thing agreed on 

the first passage v b i translate literally then many 
agreed upon this namely that the seawolf had killed him 

the second passage v b she is promised to this 
the friend of the scyldings has agreed etc by emending is instead 
of ws the tenses will be brought into perfect harmony 

in v ff this same idiom occurs and was noticed in bs great 
article on beowulf which appeared about the time i published my 
reading of and translate then wouldst let the 
southdanes themselves decide about their struggle with grendel here 
sdene is accus of person and ge is gen of thing agreed on 

with such collateral support as that afforded by b p and b xii 
i have no hesitation in departing from hso my usual guide 

the idiom above treated runs through as old saxon and other 
teutonic languages and should be noticed in the lexicons

sword translate the damaskeened sword burned up cf and

beowulf brings his trophieshrothgars gratitude 


beowulf relates his last exploit 

beowulf spake offspring of ecgtheow 
lo we blithely have brought thee bairn of healfdene 
prince of the scyldings these presents from ocean 
which thine eye looketh on for an emblem of glory 
i came off alive from this narrowly scaping 
in war neath the water the work with great pains i 
performed and the fight had been finished quite nearly 
had god not defended me i failed in the battle 
aught to accomplish aided by hrunting 
though that weapon was worthy but the wielder of earthfolk 

god was fighting with me 

gave me willingly to see on the wall a 
heavy old handsword hanging in splendor 
he guided most often the lorn and the friendless 
that i swung as a weapon the wards of the house then 
i killed in the conflict when occasion was given me 
then the battlesword burned the brand that was lifted 
as the bloodcurrent sprang hottest of warsweats 
seizing the hilt from my foes i offbore it 
i avenged as i ought to their acts of malignity 
the murder of danemen i then make thee this promise 

heorot is freed from monsters 

thoult be able in heorot careless to slumber 
with thy throng of heroes and the thanes of thy people 
every and each of greater and lesser 
and thou needest not fear for them from the selfsame direction 
as thou formerly fearedst oh folklord of scyldings 
endday for earlmen to the agehoary man then 

the famous sword is presented to hrothgar 

the grayhaired chieftain the goldfashioned swordhilt 
oldwork of giants was thereupon given 
since the fall of the fiends it fell to the keeping 
of the wielder of danemen the wondersmiths labor 
and the badmooded being abandoned this world then 
opponent of god victim of murder 
and also his mother it went to the keeping 
of the best of the worldkings where waters encircle 
who the scot divided in scylding dominion 

hrothgar looks closely at the old sword 

hrothgar discoursed the hilt he regarded 
the ancient heirloom where an oldtime contentions 
beginning was graven the gurgling currents 
the flood slew thereafter the race of the giants 
they had proved themselves daring that people was loth to 

it had belonged to a race hateful to god 

the lord everlasting through lash of the billows 
the father gave them final requital 
so in letters of rune on the clasp of the handle 
gleaming and golden twas graven exactly 
set forth and said whom that sword had been made for 
finest of irons who first it was wrought for 
wreathed at its handle and gleaming with serpents 
the wise one then said silent they all were 

hrothgar praises beowulf 

son of old healfdene he may say unrefuted 
who performs mid the folkmen fairness and truth 
the hoary old ruler remembers the past 
that better by birth is this bairn of the nobles 
thy fame is extended through faraway countries 
good friend beowulf oer all of the races 
thou holdest all firmly herolike strength with 
prudence of spirit ill prove myself grateful 
as before we agreed on thou granted for long shalt 
become a great comfort to kinsmen and comrades 

heremods career is again contrasted with beowulfs 

a help unto heroes heremod became not 
such to the scyldings successors of ecgwela 
he grew not to please them but grievous destruction 
and diresome deathwoes to danemen attracted 
he slew in anger his tablecompanions 
trustworthy counsellors till he turned off lonely 
from worldjoys away widefamous ruler 
though highruling heaven in herostrength raised him 
in might exalted him oer men of all nations 
made him supreme yet a murderous spirit 
grew in his bosom he gave then no ringgems 

a wretched failure of a king to give no jewels to his retainers 

to the danes after custom endured he unjoyful 
standing the straits from strife that was raging 
longsome folksorrow learn then from this 
lay hold of virtue though laden with winters 
i have sung thee these measures tis a marvel to tell it 

hrothgar moralizes 

how allruling god from greatness of spirit 
giveth wisdom to children of men 
manor and earlship all things he ruleth 
he often permitteth the moodthought of man of 
the illustrious lineage to lean to possessions 
allows him earthly delights at his manor 
a highburg of heroes to hold in his keeping 
maketh portions of earthfolk hear him 
and a widereaching kingdom so that wisdom failing him 
he himself is unable to reckon its boundaries 
he liveth in luxury little debars him 
nor sickness nor age no treacherysorrow 
becloudeth his spirit conflict nowhere 
no swordhate appeareth but all of the world doth 
wend as he wisheth the worse he knoweth not 
till arrant arrogance inward pervading 
waxeth and springeth when the warder is sleeping 
the guard of the soul with sorrows encompassed 
too sound is his slumber the slayer is near him 
who with bow and arrow aimeth in malice 



or rather perhaps the inlaid or damaskeened weapon cf 
and note 




xxvi 

hrothgar moralizesrest after labor 


a wounded spirit 

then bruised in his bosom he with bittertoothed missile 
is hurt neath his helmet from harmful pollution 
he is powerless to shield him by the wonderful mandates 
of the loathcursd spirit what too long he hath holden 
him seemeth too small savage he hoardeth 
nor boastfully giveth goldplated rings 
the fate of the future flouts and forgetteth 
since god had erst given him greatness no little 
wielder of glory his endday anear 
it afterward happens that the bodilydwelling 
fleetingly fadeth falls into ruins 
another lays hold who doleth the ornaments 
the noblemans jewels nothing lamenting 
heedeth no terror oh beowulf dear 
best of the heroes from balestrife defend thee 
and choose thee the better counsels eternal 

be not over proud life is fleeting and its strength soon wasteth away 

beware of arrogance worldfamous champion 
but a littlewhile lasts thy lifevigors fulness 
twill after hap early that illness or swordedge 
shall part thee from strength or the grasp of the fire 
or the wave of the current or clutch of the edges 
or flight of the warspear or age with its horrors 
or thine eyes bright flashing shall fade into darkness 
twill happen full early excellent hero 

hrothgar gives an account of his reign 

that death shall subdue thee so the danes a halfcentury 
i held under heaven helped them in struggles 
gainst many a race in middleearths regions

on earth molested me lo offsetting change now 



sorrow after joy 

came to my manor grief after joyance 
when grendel became my constant visitor 
inveterate hater i from that malice 
continually travailed with trouble no little 
thanks be to god that i gained in my lifetime 
to the lord everlasting to look on the gory 
head with mine eyes after longlasting sorrow 
go to the bench now battleadornd 
joy in the feasting of jewels in common 
well meet with many when morning appeareth 
the geatman was gladsome ganged he immediately 
to go to the bench as the clever one bade him 
then again as before were the famousforprowess 
hallinhabiters handsomely banqueted 
feasted anew the nightveil fell then 
dark oer the warriors the courtiers rose then 
the grayhaired was anxious to go to his slumbers 
the hoary old scylding hankered the geatman 

beowulf is fagged and seeks rest 

the champion doughty greatly to rest him

were bounden to feel the bighearted rested 
the building uptowered spacious and gilded

blithely foreboded the beacon of heaven 
then the brightshining sun oer the bottoms came going

were ready to go again to their peoples

sorrow at parting 


beowulfs farewell 

beowulf spake ecgtheows offspring 
we men of the water wish to declare now 
fared from farlands were firmly determined 
to seek king higelac here have we fitly 
been welcomed and feasted as heart would desire it 
good was the greeting if greater affection 
i am anywise able ever on earth to 
gain at thy hands ruler of heroes 
than yet i have done i shall quickly be ready 

i shall be ever ready to aid thee 

for combat and conflict oer the course of the waters 
learn i that neighbors alarm thee with terror 
as haters did whilom i hither will bring thee 
for help unto heroes henchmen by thousands 

my liegelord will encourage me in aiding thee 

i know as to higelac the lord of the geatmen 
though young in years he yet will permit me 
by words and by works ward of the people 
fully to furnish thee forces and bear thee 
my lance to relieve thee if liegemen shall fail thee 
and help of my handstrength if hrethric be treating 
bairn of the king at the court of the geatmen 
he thereat may find him friends in abundance 
faraway countries he were better to seek for 
who trusts in himself hrothgar discoursed then 
making rejoinder these words thou hast uttered 
allknowing god hath given thy spirit 

o beowulf thou art wise beyond thy years 

neer heard i an earlman thus early in life 
more clever in speaking thourt cautious of spirit 
mighty of muscle in mouthanswers prudent 
i count on the hope that happen it ever 
that missile shall rob thee of hrethels descendant 
edgehorrid battle and illness or weapon 
deprive thee of prince of peoples protector 

should higelac die the geats could find no better successor than thou 
wouldst make 

and life thou yet holdest the seageats will never 
find a more fitting folklord to choose them 
gemward of heroes than thou mightest prove thee 
if the kingdom of kinsmen thou carest to govern 
thy moodspirit likes me the longer the better 
beowulf dear thou hast brought it to pass that 
to both these peoples peace shall be common 

thou hast healed the ancient breach between our races 

to geatfolk and danemen the strife be suspended 
the secret assailings they suffered in yoredays 
and also that jewels be shared while i govern 
the widestretching kingdom and that many shall visit 
others oer the ocean with excellent giftgems 
the ringadorned bark shall bring oer the currents 
presents and lovegifts this people i know 
towrd foeman and friend firmly established 
after ancient etiquette everywise blameless 
then the warden of earlmen gave him still farther 

parting gifts 

kinsman of healfdene a dozen of jewels 
bade him safely seek with the presents 
his wellbeloved people early returning 



hrothgar kisses beowulf and weeps 

then the nobleborn king kissed the distinguished 
dearlovd liegeman the daneprince saluted him 
and claspd his neck tears from him fell 
from the grayheaded man he two things expected 
agd and reverend but rather the second 
that bold in council theyd meet thereafter 
the man was so dear that he failed to suppress the 
emotions that moved him but in moodfetters fastened 

the old king is deeply grieved to part with his benefactor 

the longfamous hero longeth in secret 
deep in his spirit for the dearbeloved man 
though not a bloodkinsman beowulf thenceward 
goldsplendid warrior walked oer the meadows 
exulting in treasure the seagoing vessel 
riding at anchor awaited its owner 
as they pressed on their way then the present of hrothgar 

giving liberally is the true proof of kingship 

was frequently referred to a folkking indeed that 
everyway blameless till age did debar him 
the joys of his might which hath many oft injured 

for geworhte the crux of this passage b proposes gehte 
rendering i know this people with firm thought every way blameless 
towards foe and friends 

s and b emend so as to negative the verb meet why should 
hrothgar weep if he expects to meet beowulf again both these 
scholars ask but the weeping is mentioned before the expectations 
the tears may have been due to many emotions especially gratitude 
struggling for expression

to the boatward a goldbound brand he presented 
that he was afterwards honored on the alebench more highly 
as the heirlooms owner set he out on his vessel 
to drive on the deep danecountry left he

driven by breezes stood on the shore 

the portwarden is anxiously looking for them 

prompt at the ocean the portward was ready

fast in its fetters lest the force of the waters 
should be able to injure the oceanwood winsome 
bade he up then take the treasure of princes

out to drive on the sea the danecountry left on bears the 
alliteration cf on hafu this has some advantages over the 
hso reading viz it adds nothing to the text it makes 
naca the subject and thus brings the passage into keeping with the 
context where the poet has exhausted his vocabulary in detailing the 
actions of the vesselbs emendation cf p and b xii is 
violent

beowulf and higelac 


then the brave one departed his band along with him 

beowulf and his party seek higelac 

seeking the seashore the seamarches treading 
the widestretching shores the worldcandle glimmered 
the sun from the southward they proceeded then onward 
early arriving where they heard that the trooplord 
ongentheows slayer excellent youthful 
folkprince and warrior was distributing jewels 
close in his castle the coming of beowulf 
was announced in a message quickly to higelac 
that the folktroops defender forth to the palace 
the lindencompanion alive was advancing 
secure from the combat courtward agoing 
the building was early inward made ready 
for the footgoing guests as the good one had ordered 

beowulf sits by his liegelord 

he sat by the man then who had lived through the struggle 
kinsman by kinsman when the king of the people 
had in lordly language saluted the dear one 

queen hygd receives the heroes 

in words that were formal the daughter of hreth 
coursed through the building carrying meadcups 
she loved the retainers tendered the beakers 
to the highminded geatmen higelac gan then 

higelac is greatly interested in beowulfs adventures 

pleasantly plying his companion with questions 
in the hightowering palace a curious interest 
tormented his spirit what meaning to see in 
the seageats adventures beowulf worthy 

give an account of thy adventures beowulf dear 

how throve your journeying when thou thoughtest suddenly 
far oer the saltstreams to seek an encounter 
a battle at heorot hast bettered for hrothgar 
the famous folkleader his farpublished sorrows 
any at all in agonybillows 

my suspense has been great 

i mused upon torture distrusted the journey 
of the belovd liegeman i long time did pray thee 
by no means to seek out the murderous spirit 
to suffer the southdanes themselves to decide on 
grappling with grendel to god i am thankful 
to be suffered to see thee safe from thy journey 

beowulf narrates his adventures 

beowulf answered bairn of old ecgtheow 
tis hidden by no means higelac chieftain 
from many of men the meeting so famous 
what mournful moments of me and of grendel 
were passed in the place where he pressing affliction 
on the victoryscyldings scathefully brought

beowulf narrates his adventures to higelac 


it well may discomfit the prince of the heathobards 
and each of the thanemen of earls that attend him 
when he goes to the building escorting the woman 
that a nobleborn daneman the knights should be feasting 
there gleam on his person the leavings of elders 
hard and ringbright heathobards treasure 
while they wielded their arms till they misled to the battle 
their own dear lives and belovd companions 
he saith at the banquet who the collar beholdeth 
an ancient ashwarrior who earlmens destruction 
clearly recalleth cruel his spirit 
sadly beginneth sounding the youthful 
thanechampions spirit through the thoughts of his bosom 
wargrief to waken and this wordanswer speaketh 

ingeld is stirred up to break the truce 

art thou able my friend to know when thou seest it 
the brand which thy father bare to the conflict 
in his latest adventure neath visor of helmet 
the dearlyloved iron where danemen did slay him 
and bravemooded scyldings on the fall of the heroes 
when vengeance was sleeping the slaughterplace wielded 
een now some man of the murderers progeny 
exulting in ornaments enters the building 
boasts of his bloodshedding offbeareth the jewel 
which thou shouldst wholly hold in possession 
so he urgeth and mindeth on every occasion 
with woebringing words till waxeth the season 
when the womans thane for the works of his father 
the bill having bitten bloodgory sleepeth 
fated to perish the other one thenceward 
scapeth alive the land knoweth thoroughly 
then the oaths of the earlmen on each side are broken 
when rancors unresting are raging in ingeld 
and his wifelove waxeth less warm after sorrow 
so the heathobards favor not faithful i reckon 
their part in the treaty not true to the danemen 
their friendship not fast i further shall tell thee 



having made these preliminary statements i will now tell thee of 
grendel the monster 

more about grendel that thou fully mayst hear 
ornamentgiver what afterward came from 
the handrush of heroes when heavens bright jewel 
oer earthfields had glided the stranger came raging

where wholly unharmed the hall we were guarding 

hondscio fell first 

to hondscio happened a hopeless contention 
death to the doomed one dead he fell foremost 
girded warchampion to him grendel became then 
to the vassal distinguished a toothweaponed murderer 
the wellbeloved henchmans body all swallowed 
not the earlier off empty of hand did 
the bloodytoothed murderer mindful of evils 
wish to escape from the goldgivers palace 
but sturdy of strength he strove to outdo me 
handready grappled a glove was suspended 
spacious and wondrous in artfetters fastened 
which was fashioned entirely by touch of the craftman 
from the dragons skin by the devils devices 
he down in its depths would do me unsadly 
one among many deeddoer raging 
though sinless he saw me not so could it happen 
when i in my anger upright did stand 
tis too long to recount how requital i furnished 
for every evil to the earlmens destroyer 

i reflected honor upon my people 

twas there my prince that i proudly distinguished 
thy land with my labors he left and retreated 
he lived his life a little while longer 
yet his righthand guarded his footstep in heorot 
and sadmooded thence to the seabottom fell he 
mournful in mind for the mightrush of battle 

king hrothgar lavished gifts upon me 

the friend of the scyldings with gold that was plated 
with ornaments many much requited me 
when daylight had dawned and down to the banquet 
we had sat us together there was chanting and joyance 
the agestricken scylding asked many questions 
and of oldtimes related oft lightringing harpstrings 
joytelling wood were touched by the brave one 
now he uttered measures mourning and truthful 
then the largehearted landking a legend of wonder 
truthfully told us now troubled with years 

the old king is sad over the loss of his youthful vigor 

the agehoary warrior afterward began to 
mourn for the might that marked him in youthdays 
his breast within boiled when burdened with winters 
much he remembered from morning till night then 
we joyed us therein as etiquette suffered 
till the second night season came unto earthfolk 
then early thereafter the mother of grendel 

grendels mother 

was ready for vengeance wretched she journeyed 
her son had death ravished the wrath of the geatmen 
the horrible woman avengd her offspring 
and with mighty mainstrength murdered a hero 

schere falls a prey to her vengeance 

there the spirit of schere agd adviser 
was ready to vanish nor when morn had lightened 
were they anywise suffered to consume him with fire 
folk of the danemen the deathweakened hero 
nor the belovd liegeman to lay on the pyre 

she suffered not his body to be burned but ate it 

she the corpse had offcarried in the clutch of the foeman 
neath mountainbrooks flood to hrothgar twas saddest 
of pains that ever had preyed on the chieftain 
by the life of thee the landprince then me 
besought very sadly in seacurrents eddies 
to display my prowess to peril my safety 
mightdeeds accomplish much did he promise 

i sought the creature in her den 

i found then the famous floodcurrents cruel 
horrible depthwarder a while unto us two 
hand was in common the currents were seething 
with gore that was clotted and grendels fierce mothers 

and hewed her head off

with hugereaching swordedge hardly i wrested 
my life from her clutches not doomed was i then 

jewels were freely bestowed upon me 

but the warden of earlmen afterward gave me 
jewels in quantity kinsman of healfdene

took refuge within there he early looked in it 


when the onset surprised him 

the hoard 

he a gemvessel saw there many of suchlike 
ancient ornaments in the earthcave were lying 
as in days of yore some one of men of 
illustrious lineage as a legacy monstrous 
there had secreted them careful and thoughtful 
dearvalued jewels death had offsnatched them 
in the days of the past and the one man moreover 
of the flower of the folk who fared there the longest 
was fain to defer it friendmourning warder 
a little longer to be left in enjoyment

stood on the plain the streamcurrents nigh to

of gold that was beaten briefly he spake then

the hero plunders the dragons den 

the lornmooded liegeman his lord regarded 
the oldwork of earthfolktwas the earliest occasion

he snuffed long the stone then stouthearted found he

with cunning craftiness close to the head of 
the firespewing dragon so undoomed he may scape from 
anguish and exile with ease who possesseth 
the favor of heaven the hoardwarden eagerly 
searched oer the ground then would meet with the person 
that caused him sorrow while in slumber reclining 
gleaming and wild he oft went round the cavern 
all of it outward not any of earthmen 
was seen in that desert yet he joyed in the battle 
rejoiced in the conflict oft he turned to the barrow 
sought for the gemcup this he soon perceived then 

the dragon perceives that some one has disturbed his treasure 

that some man or other had discovered the gold 
the famous folktreasure not fain did the hoardward 
wait until evening then the ward of the barrow 
was angry in spirit the loathd one wished to 
pay for the dearvalued drinkcup with fire 
then the day was done as the dragon would have it

becoming an enemy ohtheres son then 
went with a wartroop oer the widestretching currents 
with warriors and weapons with woejourneys cold he 
after avenged him the kings life he took 

beowulf has been preserved through many perils 

so he came off uninjured from all of his battles 
perilous fights offspring of ecgtheow 
from his deeds of daring till that day most momentous 
when he fatedriven fared to fight with the dragon 

with eleven comrades he seeks the dragon 

with eleven companions the prince of the geatmen 
went lowering with fury to look at the firedrake 
inquiring hed found how the feud had arisen 
hate to his heroes the highlyfamed gemvessel 
was brought to his keeping through the hand of th informer 

a guide leads the way but 

that in the throng was thirteenth of heroes 
that caused the beginning of conflict so bitter 
captive and wretched must sadmooded thenceward 

very reluctantly 

point out the place he passed then unwillingly 
to the spot where he knew of the notable cavern 
the cave under earth not far from the ocean 
the anger of eddies which inward was full of 
jewels and wires a warden uncanny 
warrior weaponed wardered the treasure 
old under earth no easy possession 
for any of earthfolk access to get to 
then the battlebrave atheling sat on the nazeedge 
while the goldfriend of geatmen gracious saluted 
his firesidecompanions woe was his spirit 
deathboding wavring weird very near him 
who must seize the old hero his soultreasure look for 
dragging aloof his life from his body 
not fleshhidden long was the folkleaders spirit 
beowulf spake ecgtheows son 

beowulfs retrospect 

i survived in my youthdays many a conflict 
hours of onset that all i remember 
i was sevenwinters old when the jewelprince took me 
highlord of heroes at the hands of my father 
hrethel the heroking had me in keeping 

hrethel took me when i was seven 

gave me treasure and feasting our kinship remembered 
not ever was i any less dear to him 

he treated me as a son 

knight in the boroughs than the bairns of his household 
herebald and hthcyn and higelac mine 
to the eldest unjustly by acts of a kinsman 
was murderbed strewn since him hthcyn from hornbow 

one of the brothers accidentally kills another 

his sheltering chieftain shot with an arrow 
erred in his aim and injured his kinsman 
one brother the other with bloodsprinkled spear 

no fee could compound for such a calamity 

twas a feeless fight finished in malice 
sad to his spirit the folkprince however 
had to part from existence with vengeance untaken 

a parallel case is supposed 

so to hoarheaded hero tis heavily crushing 
to live to see his son as he rideth 
young on the gallows then measures he chanteth 
a song of sorrow when his son is hanging 
for the ravens delight and aged and hoary 
he is unable to offer any assistance 
every morning his offsprings departure 
is constant recalled he cares not to wait for 
the birth of an heir in his boroughenclosures 
since that one through deathpain the deeds hath experienced 
he heartgrieved beholds in the house of his son the 
winebuilding wasted the windlodging places 
reaved of their roaring the riders are sleeping 
the knights in the grave theres no sound of the harpwood 
joy in the yards as of yore were familiar 

gomelum ceorle h takes these words as referring to 
hrethel but the translator here departs from his editor by 
understanding the poet to refer to a hypothetical old man introduced 
as an illustration of a fathers sorrow 

hrethrel had certainly never seen a son of his ride on the gallows to 
feed the crows 

the passage beginning sw bi gomorlic seems to be an effort to 
reach a full simile as so as it is mournful for an old man 
etc so the defence of the weders bore heartsorrow etc 
the verses to would be parenthetical the poets feelings 
being so strong as to interrupt the simile the punctuation of the 
fourth edition would be bettera comma after galgan the 
translation may be indicated as follows just as it is sad for an 
old man to see his son ride young on the gallows when he himself is 
uttering mournful measures a sorrowful song while his son hangs for a 
comfort to the raven and he old and infirm cannot render him any 
kelphe is constantly reminded etc so the defence of 
the weders etc

neath steeprising stonecliffs the strength he relied on 
of one man alone no work for a coward 
then he saw by the wall who a great many battles 
had lived through most worthy when foottroops collided 

the place of strife is described 

stonearches standing stouthearted champion 
saw a brook from the barrow bubbling out thenceward 
the flood of the fountain was fuming with warflame 
not nigh to the hoard for season the briefest 
could he brave without burning the abyss that was yawning 
the drake was so fiery the prince of the weders 
caused then that words came from his bosom 
so fierce was his fury the firmhearted shouted 
his battleclear voice came in resounding 
neath the graycolored stone stirred was his hatred 

beowulf calls out under the stone arches 

the hoardward distinguished the speech of a man 
time was no longer to look out for friendship 
the breath of the monster issued forth first

heart was then ready to seek for a struggle 

beowulf brandishes his sword 

the excellent battleking first brandished his weapon 
the ancient heirloom of edges unblunted 
to the deathplanners twain was terror from other 

and stands against his shield 

the lord of the troopers intrepidly stood then 
gainst his highrising shield when the dragon coiled him 

the dragon coils himself 

quickly together in corslet he bided 
he went then in blazes bended and striding 
hasting him forward his life and body 
the targe well protected for timeperiod shorter 
than wish demanded for the wellrenowned leader 
where he then for the first day was forced to be victor 
famous in battle as fate had not willed it 
the lord of the geatmen uplifted his hand then

wiglaf the trustybeowulf is deserted by friends and by sword 


wiglaf remains truethe ideal teutonic liegeman 

the son of weohstan was wiglaf entitled 
shieldwarrior precious prince of the scylfings 
lfheres kinsman he saw his dear liegelord 
enduring the heat neath helmet and visor 
then he minded the holding that erst he had given him 

wiglaf recalls beowulfs generosity 

the wgmunding warriors wealthblessd homestead 
each of the folkrights his father had wielded 
he was hot for the battle his hand seized the target 
the yellowbark shield he unsheathed his old weapon 
which was known among earthmen as the relic of eanmund 
ohtheres offspring whom exiled and friendless 
weohstan did slay with swordedge in battle 
and carried his kinsman the clearshining helmet 
the ringmade burnie the old giantweapon 
that onela gave him his boonfellows armor 
ready wartrappings he the feud did not mention 
though hed fatally smitten the son of his brother 
many a halfyear held he the treasures 
the bill and the burnie till his bairn became able 
like his father before him famedeeds to complish 
then he gave him mong geatmen a goodly array of 
weeds for his warfare he went from life then 
old on his journey twas the earliest time then 

this is wiglafs first battle as liegeman of beowulf 

that the youthful champion might charge in the battle 
aiding his liegelord his spirit was dauntless 
nor did kinsmans bequest quail at the battle 
this the dragon discovered on their coming together 
wiglaf uttered many a rightsaying 
said to his fellows sad was his spirit 

wiglaf appeals to the pride of the cowards 

i remember the time when tasting the meadcup 
we promised in the hall the lord of us all 
who gave us these ringtreasures that this battleequipment 
swords and helmets wed certainly quite him 
should need of such aid ever befall him 

how we have forfeited our liegelords confidence 

in the warband he chose us for this journey spontaneously 
stirred us to glory and gave me these jewels 
since he held and esteemed us trustworthy spearmen 
hardy helmbearers though this heroachievement 
our lord intended alone to accomplish 
ward of his people for most of achievements 
doings audacious he did among earthfolk 

our lord is in sore need of us 

the day is now come when the ruler of earthmen 
needeth the vigor of valiant heroes 
let us wend us towards him the warprince to succor 
while the heat yet rageth horrible firefight 

i would rather die than go home with out my suzerain 

god wot in me tis mickle the liefer 
the blaze should embrace my body and eat it 
with my treasurebestower meseemeth not proper 
to bear our battleshields back to our country 
less first we are able to fell and destroy the 
longhating foeman to defend the life of 

surely he does not deserve to die alone 

the prince of the weders well do i know tisnt 
earned by his exploits he only of geatmen 
sorrow should suffer sink in the battle 
brand and helmet to us both shall be common 
shieldcover burnie through the balesmoke he stalked then 
went under helmet to the help of his chieftain 

wiglaf reminds beowulf of his youthful boasts 

briefly discoursing beowulf dear 
perform thou all fully as thou formerly saidst 
in thy youthful years that while yet thou livedst 
thou wouldst let thine honor not ever be lessened 
thy life thou shalt save mighty in actions 
atheling undaunted with all of thy vigor 

the monster advances on them 

ill give thee assistance the dragon came raging 
wildmooded stranger when these words had been uttered 
twas the second occasion seeking his enemies 
men that were hated with hotgleaming firewaves 
with blazebillows burned the board to its edges 
the fightarmor failed then to furnish assistance 
to the youthful spearhero but the youngagd stripling 
quickly advanced neath his kinsmans wartarget 
since his own had been ground in the grip of the fire 

beowulf strikes at the dragon 

then the warriorking was careful of glory 
he soundly smote with swordforthebattle 
that it stood in the head by hatred driven 
ngling was shivered the old and ironmade 

his sword fails him 

brand of beowulf in battle deceived him 
twas denied him that edges of irons were able 
to help in the battle the hand was too mighty 
which every weapon as i heard on inquiry 
outstruck in its stroke when to struggle he carried 
the wonderful warsword it waxed him no better 

the dragon advances on beowulf again 

then the peopledespoilerthird of his onsets 
fierceraging firedrake of feudhate was mindful 
charged on the strong one when chance was afforded 
heated and wargrim seized on his neck 
with teeth that were bitter he bloody did wax with 
soulgore seething swordblood in waves boiled

the fatal strugglebeowulfs last moments 


wiglaf defends beowulf 

then i heard that at need of the king of the people 
the upstanding earlman exhibited prowess 
vigor and courage as suited his nature 
he his head did not guard but the highminded liegemans 
hand was consumed when he succored his kinsman 
so he struck the strifebringing strangecomer lower 
earlthane in armor that in went the weapon 
gleaming and plated that gan then the fire 

beowulf draws his knife 

later to lessen the liegelord himself then 
retained his consciousness brandished his warknife 
battlesharp bitter that he bare on his armor 

and cuts the dragon 

the wederlord cut the worm in the middle 
they had felled the enemy life drove out then 
puissant prowess the pair had destroyed him 
landchiefs related so a liegeman should prove him 
a thaneman when needed to the prince twas the last of 
his era of conquest by his own great achievements 



beowulfs wound swells and burns 

the latest of worlddeeds the wound then began 
which the earthdwelling dragon erstwhile had wrought him 
to burn and to swell he soon then discovered 
that bitterest balewoe in his bosom was raging 
poison within the atheling advanced then 

he sits down exhausted 

that along by the wall he prudent of spirit 
might sit on a settle he saw the giantwork 
how arches of stone strengthened with pillars 
the earthhall eternal inward supported 
then the longworthy liegeman laved with his hand the 

wiglaf bathes his lords head

refreshing the face of his friendlord and ruler 
sated with battle unbinding his helmet 
beowulf answered of his injury spake he 
his wound that was fatal he was fully aware 
he had lived his allotted lifedays enjoying 
the pleasures of earth then past was entirely 
his measure of days death very near 

beowulf regrets that he has no son 

my son i would give now my battleequipments

along of my body this people i governed 
fifty of winters no king mong my neighbors

wiglaf plunders the dragons denbeowulfs death 


wiglaf fulfils his lords behest 

then heard i that wihstans son very quickly 
these words being uttered heeded his liegelord 
wounded and warsick went in his armor 
his wellwoven ringmail neath the roof of the barrow 
then the trusty retainer treasuregems many 

the dragons den 

victorious saw when the seat he came near to 
goldtreasure sparkling spread on the bottom 
wonder on the wall and the wormcreatures cavern 
the ancient dawnfliers vessels astanding 
cups of the ancients of cleansers bereavd 
robbed of their ornaments there were helmets in numbers 
old and rusteaten armbracelets many 
artfully woven wealth can easily 
gold on the seabottom turn into vanity 
each one of earthmen arm him who pleaseth 
and he saw there lying an allgolden banner 
high oer the hoard of handwonders greatest 
linkd with lacets a light from it sparkled 
that the floor of the cavern he was able to look on 

the dragon is not there 

to examine the jewels sight of the dragon 
not any was offered but edge offcarried him 

wiglaf bears the hoard away 

then i heard that the hero the hoardtreasure plundered 
the giantwork ancient reaved in the cavern 
bare on his bosom the beakers and platters 
as himself would fain have it and took off the standard 
the brightest of beacons the bill had erst injured 
its edge was of iron the oldrulers weapon 
him who long had watched as ward of the jewels 
who fireterror carried hot for the treasure 
rolling in battle in middlemost darkness 
till murdered he perished the messenger hastened 
not loth to return hurried by jewels 
curiosity urged him if excellentmooded 
alive he should find the lord of the weders 
mortally wounded at the place where he left him 
mid the jewels he found then the famous old chieftain 
his liegelord belovd at his lifesend gory 
he thereupon gan to lave him with water 
till the point of his word piercd his breasthoard 
beowulf spake the goldgems he noticed 

beowulf is rejoiced to see the jewels 

the old one in sorrow for the jewels i look on 
thanks do i utter for all to the ruler 
wielder of worship with words of devotion 
the lord everlasting that he let me such treasures 
gain for my people ere death overtook me 
since ive bartered the agd life to me granted 
for treasure of jewels attend ye henceforward 

he desires to be held in memory by his people 

the wants of the warthanes i can wait here no longer 
the battlefamed bid ye to build them a gravehill 
bright when im burned at the brimcurrents limit 
as a memorymark to the men i have governed 
aloft it shall tower on whalesness uprising 
that earls of the ocean hereafter may call it 
beowulfs barrow those who barks everdashing 
from a distance shall drive oer the darkness of waters 

the heros last gift 

the boldmooded trooplord took from his neck then 
the ring that was golden gave to his liegeman 
the youthful warhero his goldflashing helmet 
his collar and warmail bade him well to enjoy them 

and last words 

thou art latest left of the line of our kindred 
of wgmunding people weird hath offcarried 
all of my kinsmen to the creators glory 
earls in their vigor i shall after them fare 
twas the aged liegelords lastspoken word in 
his musings of spirit ere he mounted the fire 
the battlewaves burning from his bosom departed 
his soul to seek the sainted ones glory 

the word oferhgian being vague and little understood 
two quite distinct translations of this passage have arisen one takes 
oferhgian as meaning to exceed and inserting hord after 
gehwone renders the treasure may easily the gold in the ground 
exceed in value every hoard of man hide it who will the other takes 
oferhgian as meaning to render arrogant and giving the sentence 
a moralizing tone renders substantially as in the body of this work 
cf et seq 

the passage beginning here is very much disputed the bill of the 
old lord is by some regarded as beowulfs sword by others as that 
of the ancient possessor of the hoard r gescd translated 
in this work as verb and adverb is by some regarded as a compound 
participial adj sheathed in brass

the dead foeswiglafs bitter taunts 


wiglaf is sorely grieved to see his lord look so unwarlike 

it had wofully chanced then the youthful retainer 
to behold on earth the most ardentbelovd 
at his lifedays limit lying there helpless 
the slayer too lay there of life all bereavd 
horrible earthdrake harassed with sorrow 

the dragon has plundered his last hoard 

the roundtwisted monster was permitted no longer 
to govern the ringhoards but edges of warswords 
mightily seized him battlesharp sturdy 
leavings of hammers that still from his wounds 
the flierfromfarland fell to the earth 
hard by his hoardhouse hopped he at midnight 
not eer through the air nor exulting in jewels 
suffered them to see him but he sank then to earthward 
through the herochiefs handwork i heard sure it throve then 



few warriors dared to face the monster 

but few in the land of liegemen of valor 
though of every achievement bold he had proved him 
to run gainst the breath of the venomous scather 
or the hall of the treasure to trouble with handblows 
if he watching had found the ward of the hoardhall 
on the barrow abiding beowulfs part of 
the treasure of jewels was paid for with death 
each of the twain had attained to the end of 
life so unlasting not long was the time till 

the cowardly thanes come out of the thicket 

the tardyatbattle returned from the thicket 
the timid trucebreakers ten all together 
who durst not before play with the lances 
in the prince of the peoples pressing emergency 

they are ashamed of their desertion 

but blushing with shame with shields they betook them 
with arms and armor where the old one was lying 
they gazed upon wiglaf he was sitting exhausted 
footgoing fighter not far from the shoulders 
of the lord of the people would rouse him with water 
no whit did it help him though he hoped for it keenly 
he was able on earth not at all in the leader 
life to retain and nowise to alter 
the will of the wielder the worldrulers power 
would govern the actions of each one of heroes 

wiglaf is ready to excoriate them 

as yet he is doing from the young one forthwith then 
could grimworded greeting be got for him quickly 
whose courage had failed him wiglaf discoursed then 
weohstan his son sadmooded hero 

he begins to taunt them 

looked on the hated he who soothness will utter 
can say that the liegelord who gave you the jewels 
the ornamentarmor wherein ye are standing 
when on alebench often he offered to hallmen 
helmet and burnie the prince to his liegemen 
as best upon earth he was able to find him 



surely our lord wasted his armor on poltroons 

that he wildly wasted his wargear undoubtedly 
when battle oertook him the troopking no need had 
to glory in comrades yet god permitted him 

he however got along without you 

victorywielder with weapon unaided 
himself to avenge when vigor was needed 
i lifeprotection but little was able 
to give him in battle and i gan notwithstanding 

with some aid i could have saved our liegelord 

helping my kinsman my strength overtaxing 
he waxed the weaker when with weapon i smote on 
my mortal opponent the fire less strongly 
flamed from his bosom too few of protectors 
came round the king at the critical moment 

giftgiving is over with your people the ringlord is dead 

now must ornamenttaking and weaponbestowing 
homejoyance all cease for your kindred 
food for the people each of your warriors 
must needs be bereavd of rights that he holdeth 
in landed possessions when faraway nobles 
shall learn of your leaving your lord so basely 

what is life without honor 

the dastardly deed death is more pleasant 
to every earlman than infamous life is 

for ddum rdan b suggests da rdan and renders 
the might or judgment of god would determine death for every man 
as he still does 

some critics h himself in earlier editions put the clause 
when him as beget with the following sentence 
that is they make it dependent upon orfte instead of upon 
forwurpe

the messenger of death 


wiglaf sends the news of beowulfs death to liegemen near by

the messengers retrospect 


the messenger continues and refers to the feuds of swedes and geats 

the bloodstaind trace of swedes and geatmen 
the deathrush of warmen widely was noticed 
how the folks with each other feud did awaken 
the worthy one went then with wellbeloved comrades 
old and dejected to go to the fastness 
ongentheo earl upward then turned him 
of higelacs battle hed heard on inquiry 
the exultant ones prowess despaired of resistance 
with earls of the ocean to be able to struggle 
gainst seagoing sailors to save the hoardtreasure 
his wife and his children he fled after thenceward 
old neath the earthwall then was offered pursuance 
to the braves of the swedemen the banner to higelac 
they fared then forth oer the fieldofprotection 
when the hrethling heroes hedgeward had thronged them 
then with edges of irons was ongentheow driven 
the grayhaired to tarry that the troopruler had to 
suffer the power solely of eofor 

wulf wounds ongentheow 

wulf then wildly with weapon assaulted him 
wonred his son that for swinge of the edges 
the blood from his body burst out in currents 
forth neath his hair he feared not however 
grayheaded scylfing but speedily quited 

ongentheow gives a stout blow in return 

the wasting woundstroke with worse exchange 
when the king of the thanetroop thither did turn him 
the wisemooded son of wonred was powerless 
to give a returnblow to the agehoary man 
but his headshielding helmet first hewed he to pieces 
that flecked with gore perforce he did totter 
fell to the earth not fey was he yet then 
but up did he spring though an edgewound had reached him 

eofor smites ongentheow fiercely 

then higelacs vassal valiant and dauntless 
when his brother lay dead made his broadbladed weapon 
giantsword ancient defence of the giants 
bound oer the shieldwall the folkprince succumbed then 

ongentheow is slain 

shepherd of people was pierced to the vitals 
there were many attendants who bound up his kinsman 
carried him quickly when occasion was granted 
that the place of the slain they were suffered to manage 
this pending one hero plundered the other 
his armor of iron from ongentheow ravished 
his hardsword hilted and helmet together 

eofor takes the old kings wargear to higelac 

the old ones equipments he carried to higelac 
he the jewels received and rewards mid the troopers 
graciously promised and so did accomplish 
the king of the weders requited the warrush 
hrethels descendant when home he repaired him 

higelac rewards the brothers 

to eofor and wulf with widelavished treasures 
to each of them granted a hundred of thousands 
in land and rings wrought out of wire 

his gifts were beyond cavil 

none upon midearth needed to twit him 
with the gifts he gave them when glory they conquered 

to eofor he also gives his only daughter in marriage 

and to eofor then gave he his one only daughter 
the honor of home as an earnest of favor 
thats the feud and hatredas ween i twill happen 
the anger of earthmen that earls of the swedemen 
will visit on us when they hear that our leader 
lifeless is lying he who longtime protected 
his hoard and kingdom gainst hating assailers 
who on the fall of the heroes defended of yore 
the deedmighty scyldings did for the troopers 
what best did avail them and further moreover 

it is time for us to pay the last marks of respect to our lord 

herodeeds complished now is haste most fitting 
that the lord of liegemen we look upon yonder 
and that one carry on journey to deathpyre 
who ringpresents gave us not aught of it all 
shall melt with the brave onetheres a mass of bright jewels 
gold beyond measure grewsomely purchased 
and ending it all ornamentrings too 
bought with his life these fire shall devour 
flame shall cover no earlman shall wear 
a jewelmemento nor beautiful virgin 
have on her neck rings to adorn her 
but wretched in spirit bereavd of goldgems 
she shall oft with others be exiled and banished 
since the leader of liegemen hath laughter forsaken 
mirth and merriment hence many a warspear 
cold from the morning shall be clutched in the fingers 
heaved in the hand no harpmusics sound shall 
waken the warriors but the wancoated raven 
fain over fey ones freely shall gabble 
shall say to the eagle how he sped in the eating 
when the wolf his companion he plundered the slain 
so the highminded hero was rehearsing these stories 
loathsome to hear he lied as to few of 

the warriors go sadly to look at beowulfs lifeless body 

weirds and of words all the wartroop arose then 
neath the eagles cape sadly betook them 
weeping and woful the wonder to look at 
they saw on the sand then soulless alying 
his slaughterbed holding him who rings had given them 
in days that were done then the deathbringing moment 
was come to the good one that the king very warlike 
wielder of weders with wonderdeath perished 
first they beheld there a creature more wondrous 

they also see the dragon 

the worm on the field in front of them lying 
the foeman before them the firespewing dragon 
ghostly and grisly guest in his terrors 
was scorched in the fire as he lay there he measured 
fifty of feet came forth in the nighttime 
to rejoice in the air thereafter departing 
to visit his den he in death was then fastened 
he would joy in no other earthhollowed caverns 
there stood round about him beakers and vessels 
dishes were lying and dearvalued weapons 
with ironrust eaten as in earths mighty bosom 
a thousand of winters there they had rested 

the hoard was under a magic spell 

that mighty bequest then with magic was guarded 
gold of the ancients that earlman not any 
the ringhall could touch save rulinggod only 
soothking of victries gave whom he wished to 

god alone could give access to it 

he is earthfolks protector to open the treasure 
een to such among mortals as seemed to him proper 

for gda which seems a surprising epithet for a geat to apply 
to the terrible ongentheow b suggests gomela the passage would 
then stand the old one went then etc 

for segn higelce k th and b propose segn higelces 
meaning higelacs banner followed the swedes in pursuits 
suggests scc higelces and renders higelacs pursuitthe 
hso reading as translated in our text means that the banner of 
the enemy was captured and brought to higelac as a trophy 

the rendering given in this translation represents the king as 
being generous beyond the possibility of reproach but some 
authorities construe him as plu and understand the passage 
to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received 
more reward than they were entitled to 

the name scyldingas here has caused much discussion and 
given rise to several theories the most important of which are as 
follows after the downfall of hrothgars family beowulf was king 
of the danes or scyldings for scyldingas read 
scylfingasthat is after killing eadgils the scylfing prince 
beowulf conquered his land and held it in subjection m 
considers a thoughtless repetition of cf hso 

b takes nihtes and hwlum as separate adverbial cases 
and renders joy in the air had he of yore by night etc he thinks 
that the idea of vanished time ought to be expressed 

the parenthesis is by some emended so as to read he ie 
god is the hope of men he is the hope of heroes grs 
reading has no parenthesis but says could touch unless god 
himself true king of victories gave to whom he would to open the 
treasure the secret place of enchanters etc the last is rejected 
on many grounds 




xlii 

wiglafs sad storythe hoard carried off 


then twas seen that the journey prospered him little 
who wrongly within had the ornaments hidden 
down neath the wall the warden erst slaughtered 
some few of the folktroop the feud then thereafter 
was hotly avengd tis a wonder where 
when the strengthfamous trooper has attained to the end of 
lifedays allotted then no longer the man may 
remain with his kinsmen where meadcups are flowing 
so to beowulf happened when the ward of the barrow 
assaults he sought for himself had no knowledge 
how his leaving this life was likely to happen 
so to doomsday famous folkleaders down did 
call it with curseswho complished it there 
that that man should be ever of illdeeds convicted 
confined in foulplaces fastened in hellbonds 
punished with plagues who this place should eer ravage 
he cared not for gold rather the wielders 
favor preferred he first to get sight of 

wiglaf addresses his comrades 

wiglaf discoursed then wihstan his son 
oft many an earlman on one mans account must 
sorrow endure as to us it hath happened 
the liegelord belovd we could little prevail on 
kingdoms keeper counsel to follow 
not to go to the guardian of the goldhoard but let him 
lie where he long was live in his dwelling 
till the end of the world met we a destiny 
hard to endure the hoard has been looked at 
been gained very grimly too grievous the fate that 
the prince of the people pricked to come thither 
i was therein and all of it looked at 
the buildings equipments since access was given me 
not kindly at all entrance permitted 

he tells them of beowulfs last moments 

within under earthwall hastily seized i 
and held in my hands a hugeweighing burden 
of hoardtreasures costly hither out bare them 
to my liegelord belovd life was yet in him 
and consciousness also the old one discoursed then 
much and mournfully commanded to greet you 

beowulfs dying request 

bade that remembering the deeds of your friendlord 
ye build on the firehill of corpses a lofty 
burialbarrow broad and farfamous 
as mid worlddwelling warriors he was widely most honored 
while he reveled in riches let us rouse us and hasten 
again to see and seek for the treasure 
the wonder neath wall the way i will show you 
that close ye may look at ringgems sufficient 
and gold in abundance let the bier with promptness 
fully be fashioned when forth we shall come 
and lift we our lord then where long he shall tarry 
wellbeloved warrior neath the wielders protection 

wiglaf charges them to build a funeralpyre 

then the son of wihstan bade orders be given 
moodvaliant man to many of heroes 
holders of homesteads that they hither from far 
leaders of liegemen should look for the good one 
with wood for his pyre the flame shall now swallow 
the wan fire shall wax the warriors leader 
who the rain of the iron often abided 
when sturdily hurled the storm of the arrows 
leapt oer lindenwall the lance rendered service 
furnished with feathers followed the arrow 
now the wisemooded son of wihstan did summon 
the best of the braves from the band of the ruler 

he takes seven thanes and enters the den 

seven together neath the enemys roof he 
went with the seven one of the heroes 
who fared at the front a fireblazing torchlight 
bare in his hand no lot then decided 
who that hoard should havoc when heroearls saw it 
lying in the cavern uncaredfor entirely 
rusting to ruin they rued then but little 
that they hastily hence hauled out the treasure 

they push the dragon over the wall 

the dearvalued jewels the dragon eke pushed they 
the worm oer the wall let the wavecurrents take him 
the waters enwind the ward of the treasures 

the hoard is laid on a wain 

there wounden gold on a wain was uploaded 
a mass unmeasured the menleader off then 
the hero hoary to whalesness was carried 

for gehdde b suggests gehde the passage would stand as 
above except the change of hidden v to plundered the 
reference however would be to the thief not to the dragon 

the passage wundur ban m took to be a 
question asking whether it was strange that a man should die when his 
appointed time had comeb sees a corruption and makes emendations 
introducing the idea that a brave man should not die from sickness or 
from old age but should find death in the performance of some deed of 
darings sees an indirect question introduced by hwr and 
dependent upon wundur a secret is it when the hero is to die 
etcwhy may the two clauses not be parallel and the whole passage 
an old english cry of how wonderful is deathss is the best 
yet offered if wundor means mystery 

for strude in hso s suggests stride this would require 
ravage v to be changed to tread 

he cared sight of s emends so as to read as 
follows he beowulf had not before seen the favor of the avaricious 
possessor 

b renders that which drew the king thither ie the 
treasure was granted us but in such a way that it overcomes us 

folcgende b takes as dat sing with gdum and 
refers it to beowulf that is should bring firewood to the place 
where the good folkruler lay 

c proposes to take weaxan l vescor and translate 
devour this gives a parallel to fretan above the parenthesis 
would be discarded and the passage read now shall the fire consume 
the wanflame devour the prince of warriors etc 




xliii 

the burning of beowulf 


beowulfs pyre 

the folk of the geatmen got him then ready 
a pile on the earth strong for the burning 
behung with helmets heroknights targets 
and brightshining burnies as he begged they should have them 
then wailing warheroes their worldfamous chieftain 
their liegelord beloved laid in the middle 

the funeralflame 

soldiers began then to make on the barrow 
the largest of deadfires dark oer the vapor 
the smokecloud ascended the sadroaring fire 
mingled with weeping the windroar subsided 
till the building of bone it had broken to pieces 
hot in the heart heavy in spirit 
they moodsad lamented the menleaders ruin 
and mournful measures the muchgrieving widow 







the weders carry out their lords last request 

the men of the weders made accordingly 
a hill on the height high and extensive 
of seagoing sailors to be seen from a distance 
and the brave ones beacon built where the fire was 
in tendays space with a wall surrounded it 
as wisest of worldfolk could most worthily plan it 
they placed in the barrow rings and jewels 



rings and gems are laid in the barrow 

all such ornaments as erst in the treasure 
warmooded men had won in possession 
the earnings of earlmen to earth they entrusted 
the gold to the dust where yet it remaineth 
as useless to mortals as in foregoing eras 
round the deadmound rode then the doughtyinbattle 
bairns of all twelve of the chiefs of the people 

they mourn for their lord and sing his praises 

more would they mourn lament for their ruler 
speak in measure mention him with pleasure 
weighed his worth and his warlike achievements 
mightily commended as tis meet one praise his 
liegelord in words and love him in spirit 
when forth from his body he fares to destruction 
so lamented mourning the men of the geats 
fondloving vassals the fall of their lord 

an ideal king 

said he was kindest of kings under heaven 
gentlest of men most winning of manner 
friendliest to folktroops and fondest of honor 






addenda 


several discrepancies and other oversights have been noticed in the hso 
glossary of these a good part were avoided by harrison and sharp the 
american editors of beowulf in their last edition the rest will i 
hope be noticed in their fourth edition as however this book may fall 
into the hands of some who have no copy of the american edition it seems 
best to notice all the principal oversights of the german editors 

from hm notes and glossary conflict the latter not having been 
altered to suit the conclusions accepted in the former 

r gelfan sceal dryhtnes dme under dm h says the might 
of the lord while under gelfan he says the judgment of the lord 

eal bencelu under bencelu h says nom plu while under 
eal he says nom sing 

heathormas under tberan h translates to the heathoremes 
while under heathormas he says heathormas reaches breca in the 
swimmingmatch with beowulf harrison and sharp d edition avoid 
the discrepancy 

fh fondscaa under fondscaa h says a gleaming 
seamonster under fh he says hostile 

onfeng hrae inwitancum under onfn h says he received 
the maliciouslydisposed one under inwitanc he says he grasped 
etc 

nwundor son under nwundor h calls this word itself 
nom sing under son he translates it as accus sing understanding 
man as subject of son h and s d edition make the correction 

forgeaf hildebille h under the second word calls it instr 
dat while under forgifan he makes it the dat of indir obj h and s 
d edition make the change 

brd and brnecg under brd h says das breite hftmesser 
mit bronzener klinge under brnecg he says ihr breites hftmesser 
mit blitzender klinge 



yelce under this word h makes it modify std if this be 
right the punctuation of the fifth edition is wrong see h and s 
appendix 

slran geshte under sl and gescan h calls these two 
words accus plu but this is clearly an error as both are nom plu 
pred nom h and s correct under sl 

wi sylfne under wi and gesittan h says wi near by 
under self he says opposite 

ow is omitted from the glossary 

for duguum under dugu h translates this phrase in 
tchtigkeit under for by vor der edlen kriegerschaar 

r under wealdan h translates r by wo under mtan 
by da h and s suggest if in both passages 

wunde under wund h says dative and under wlblate he 
says accus it is without doubt accus parallel with benne 

strengum gebded under strengo h says strengum mit 
macht under gebded he translates von den sehnen h and s correct 
this discrepancy by rejecting the second reading 

bronda be lfe a recent emendation the fourth edition had 
bronda betost in the fifth edition the editor neglects to change the 
glossary to suit the new emendation see bewyrcan
