a man who fishes for marlin in ponds will put his money in etruscan bonds 
a good memory does not equal pale ink 
how sharper than a hounds tooth it is to have a thankless serpent 
you dialed 
its later than you think 
mistakes are oft the stepping stones to failure 
its not reality thats important but how you perceive things 
promptness is its own reward if one lives by the clock instead of the sword 
like winter snow on summer lawn time past is time gone 
far duller than a serpents tooth it is to spend a quiet youth 
let not the sands of time get in your lunch 
the attacker must vanquish the defender need only survive 
standing on head makes smile of frown but rest of face also upside down 
deprive a mirror of its silver and even the czar wont see his face 
mans horizons are bounded by his vision

even a hawk is an eagle among crows 
even the smallest candle burns brighter in the dark 
people who take cat naps dont usually sleep in a cats cradle 
a truly wise man never plays leapfrog with a unicorn 
do not clog intellects sluices with bits of knowledge of questionable uses 
let him who takes the plunge remember to return it by tuesday 
try to divide your time evenly to keep others happy 
you have mail 
his heart was yours from the first moment that you met 
sin has many tools but a lie is the handle which fits them all 
let a fool hold his tongue and he will pass for a sage 
with clothes the new are best with friends the old are best 
he is truly wise who gains wisdom from anothers mishap 
beware of a darkhaired man with a loud tie 
today is the last day of your life so far
